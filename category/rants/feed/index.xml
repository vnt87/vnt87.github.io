										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So 2021 was over, a year I believe most of us couldn&#8217;t wait to forget. So much time staying under lockdown, so many losses. I can no longer count with my fingers the number of my friends on FB who&#8217;s using a black avatar (a symbol of grievances where I come from).</p>



<p>But, sad pandemic stories aside, this year also marks the 10 year anniversary of me working professionally in the graphic design field, and I guess it&#8217;s a good time as any to take a look back and see how things have changed, and reminisce about people whom I&#8217;ve met along the way, how they helped shaping the man I am today. I will not be censoring company names, as they are publicly available in my resume, as well as my LinkedIn.</p>



<span id="more-21648"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2011-2013: the FiM era</h2>



<p>So the first company I ever work for (officially), was kind of a bust. Pay was low, the daily commute was long, work was unrewarding. They were liquidated very shortly after I quit, and eventually ghosted me of my insurance benefit, I suspect they committed fraud and didn&#8217;t pay the employee insurance they were legally required to, despite deducting it from our salaries every month. I eventually had to have the next company redo my whole insurance book for me because of that. None of that actually surprised me though, having seen the head honcho guy, some real shady mofo who resided in Hong Kong, masquerading as a venture capitalist.</p>



<p>Point is, from a work perspective, it was kinda shit.</p>



<p>But from a personal perspective though, there was&#8230;quite a lot to remember. I owe a lot to my former boss, Ms. O.  Before FiM, I was unemployed for over half a year, struggling to find my place in the world. When I came back from the States, I deeply regretted the decision to spend the previous 3 years in the States, achieving almost nothing. You know what I did during those years in the States? Half of it was spent indoors playing Counter-Strike: Source with my best friend, some of it was spent busing tables at Thai Son Noodles, serving along side people who couldn&#8217;t even read (that&#8217;s a true story I&#8217;d like to tell some other time), and flipping electronics on eBay, Craigslist and fucking Amazon. </p>



<p>During that time, my peers had moved on to work in banks and financial institutions (which is the natural career path for people with degrees like me), even though who chose a different path had at least attempted something else, something they could put down as real work experience. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, I had nothing in my CV despite having left college for over 3 years, who would take me then? </p>



<p>Ms. O took me in and offered me a place as the in house graphic designer, without even so much as asking for a CV. She heard about me from my sister, having initially tried to recruit her. And for that, I am grateful. I don&#8217;t know if she was ever involved with KS&#8217;s (the big boss) shady business practice that eventually led to everyone losing their insurance books or not, I think she might at least have some idea, given that she was the second in command, but even if she was, I&#8217;d never resent her.</p>



<p>Having said that though, I wouldn&#8217;t work for or with her again, not because of what happened with FiM, but because of her skills as a leader/mentor, or more precisely, the lack of it. I can tell she was really passionate about the business, and cared a great deal about building a strong team to back it up. Problem was, she didn&#8217;t possess the talent to do so. It wasn&#8217;t until I left FiM and met some really inspiring leader that I realized I didn&#8217;t learn anything during the 1 year and a half that I was there. At least nothing useful to my profession anyway.</p>



<p>On the personal front however, I made some major milestones during this time period. I got intimate for the first time with a girl from the office (also found out that sleeping nude with another person for a whole night wasn&#8217;t as comfortable as what the movies had led us to believe). We never made it all the way though, because we were never each other&#8217;s type anyway, it was loneliness and most likely pheromones that draw us together. But thanks to her I became a lot more emotionally mature, something that helped me greatly in later days when I meet the girl whom I would eventually marry. She also worked, albeit very briefly, at FiM. Like 2 weeks or something, but that was enough time for us to click. She was married at the time but unhappily, and I patiently waited. We&#8217;re still together now, and I can&#8217;t imagine being with anybody but her, I believe it was the most correct choice I&#8217;ve made in my life.</p>



<p>Toward the end of this era, FiM was stagnating. My job wasn&#8217;t largely unchanged for the last year and a half. Being the only &#8216;graphic design&#8217; guy in the company, I was tasked with literally everything related to graphic. From website design, logo design for potential clients (sometime provided free of charge as an addon to attract customers), to beautifying presentation decks to account managers, to designing company catalogue. I knew the end was near, but I too, was stagnating in looking for a new job. After all, I didn&#8217;t have any experience in that front, FiM was my first job, and the experience I gathered there wasn&#8217;t enough to fill a resume page. I was afraid, but eventually pulled the trigger anyway, after many of the old people left.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2014-2018: the Punch Era (DeNA + EVA)</h2>



<p>This transition was memorable for me, mainly because there was so many &#8216;first&#8217; involved.</p>



<ul><li>First time switching job.</li><li>First time experience with a headhunting agency (Harvey Nash, which as fate would have it, would become my next employer).</li><li>First career path adjustment (from general graphic design to Game UI Design)</li><li>First time having a real team (by that I mean people who also works in graphic design</li><li>First time working in an A-class office building (IPH)</li><li>First time having a foreigner as my direct supervisor (I always wanted a job where my English would be of use)</li><li>First time being sent to another country on a professional capacity (it was only Singapore, which was like a stone throw away, but still)</li></ul>



<p>I was initially interested in Punch because its wiki entry said it was an American company. It wasn&#8217;t until I joined the company that I realized it was bought by DeNA, a rather large Japanese corporation (it was one of the better ones too, as I later found out after Punch got sold yet again).</p>



<p>I had the time of my life at Punch, there was no work-life balance. For the first 2 years or so, work was life, and life was work. The company would provide each employee with around $5 for dinner if they choose to stay at the company after 7pm. &#8216;$5 for dinner&#8217; may not sound like much (redditards antiworkers would probably lose their mind at the sight of that), but it was actually quite sufficient for an average takeaway meal in Vietnam back in &#8217;14. Considering how most of the young employees actually spend less than $3 for their dinners, coupled with the fact that the company didn&#8217;t specify that you have to do company works when they stay the evening, they were pretty much feeding a third of their work force and provide them with an opportunity to have LAN party, doing personal works or just generally horsing around with their friends while all the electricity and AC is paid for.</p>



<p>It was a great time indeed.</p>



<p>It was also during my stay there that I actually know what it&#8217;s like to go on a real business trip abroad. DeNA has this policy to send random people that they deem potential to their office in Singapore for&#8230;uh to be honest I still don&#8217;t know what for. But they&#8217;d routinely send people to Singapore for a 3 to 8 weeks period. I was only on my 4th day at Punch when they slapped an airplane ticket on the table and said that I&#8217;d be leaving next Monday. It was a culture shock indeed but I ain&#8217;t complaining, it was like a free traveling opportunity with all expenses paid for.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like the days we spent in Singapore was a leisure trip anyway. We were cramped into these super tiny hotel suites that you barely have enough space to put your luggage down. Also I found out the reason why Singaporeans were so much more productive than Vietnamese. I&#8217;d usually leave the office</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A few weeks ago I made the mistake of joining another UK Project. Today I finished my voluntary withdrawal from the project, and not on a good term.</p>



<span id="more-21563"></span>



<p>In my withdrawal request letter I pointed out how the client&#8217;s so called Product Analyst continued to impede the progress for the product. Usually, a Product Analyst&#8217;s role is to write requirements and analytics and work with the designer (me) to come up with the best design solution for the product that we can come up with. This PA however, decides to install herself as the sole UI Designer, she maintains her own version of the design. Ok that&#8217;s fine, that shouldn&#8217;t pose a problem, right? We could work together on that.</p>



<p>Nope. If only.</p>



<p>She wanted me to create a completely new version of the site, completely disregard the current design language being implemented (as she said, and I quote, &#8216;the whole thing is ugly&#8217;). But the kicker is this: I cannot use the same approach as she does. I&#8217;m not even talking about design style, design language, I&#8217;m talking about the actual &#8216;approach&#8217; that you can implement on the screen. Like if she&#8217;s using table to display a list of data on a page, then I will have to come up with another way to do it WITHOUT using table, one that has to be inferior in every way. If I insists on using table, she&#8217;d immediately show her existing design and accuse you of stealing her ideas (!?)</p>



<p>To make it simpler to understand why this makes development impossible, imagine you&#8217;re being asked to make new parts for a car, that is running on the freeway. You&#8217;re not allowed to see any of the existing specs, cannot use the same material. If you want to stop the car, you cannot use the brake mechanism, because the owner of the car is already THINKING about using brakes. If you insists that brakes are the best option, you&#8217;re basically stealing the owner&#8217;s idea for his own product.</p>



<p>If that sounds dumb, that&#8217;s because it is. I&#8217;ve never seen such a workflow.</p>



<p>Obviously I didn&#8217;t use that analogy in my letter, I simply cited irreconcilable difference in the way we work. You know, like an old married couple.</p>



<p>I do admit I felt some regret after sending it in, wondering if I was too harsh with my words.</p>



<p>Today I heard from my PM about their comments on this whole incident, turns out I was the nice one. According to them:</p>



<ol><li>I am, in general, severely lacking professionalism, having abruptly declare to leave the project, and not joining their subsequent daily meeting.</li><li>I provided no tangible input after 3 weeks being on their payroll. The works I did provided was simply replications of their Product Analyst&#8217;s work.</li><li>I had, on at least 4 different occasions, canceled review meeting minutes before starting time because my work wasn&#8217;t ready.</li><li>I&#8217;m unable to take constructive criticism, and I have, get this, personally insulted their Product Analyst.</li></ol>



<p>Most if not all of these were blatant slants of what happened, but I just wanted to preface this by saying I understand why they had to spin it all on me. Being an outsourcing company, they&#8217;re technically our employer, so when an argument happens, whoever&#8217;s nicer loses. I&#8217;ve been barred from sending an official response to them to avoid escalation. Understandable, we still need their business. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t be giving my response here on my personal blog.</p>

<div class="rank-math-question ">1. Regarding my professionalism </div>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>I will concede that declaring that I&#8217;ve lost interest in the project and is leaving the project in the middle of a call is the most professional thing to do. I was fuming at the time. This is the one thing I regretted doing. But I can&#8217;t be expected to be joining their Daily meeting after I&#8217;ve already handed in my resignation the day before, can I? </p>

<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>OF COURSE there&#8217;s nothing to show BECAUSE that so called PA made sure nothing I made could be used. Remember, according to her, I have to either choose a non-viable option OR infringe on her work (again, an idea that makes no goddamn sense). </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-1024x527.png" alt="image" title="Being nice sucks sometimes 1">I wasted a massive amount of effort on this project despite the fact that I&#8217;m only billed at 50% of my effort</p>

<div class="rank-math-question ">3. Regarding cancellations of FOUR meetings at the last minute due to being &#8216;not ready&#8217;</div>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>This is a lie, and an actually elaborate one at that.<br />So as I&#8217;ve only ever canceled 2 meetings during the course of working with this person, one of which was not even due to work, but due to Microsoft Teams service completely being inaccessible in my country (thanks to the massive amount of students in VN using it for online study at the time, it was the opening day of school in VN). I took a screenshot and send it to her HOURS before our meeting with an explanation.<br />The second time, I feel like I&#8217;ve been tricked. She came on early and asked me if I&#8217;d need more time to finish all the interactions on my prototype, and I naively said yes, more time means more comprehensive prototypes. Thinking back I already felt something was off, she was a lot nicer, more friendly when I agreed to move the meeting. And the next day she&#8217;d ask me again if I want to move it, and when I said no she appears to be visibly disappointed. The thought of this being an elaborate plan to rack up evidence to use against me crossed my mind back then, but by then it was already too late. So yes, I&#8217;m guilty of being gullible on this instance, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that she made up a number to make it appear more substantial.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1631786929209" class="rank-math-list-item">
<div class="rank-math-question ">4. Regarding personal insult.</div>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>This is it, this is the one that got me. A straight up lie.<br />During our conversations, heated as they were, I&#8217;ve never made a single personal remark against her person, ever. And if you were there you&#8217;d agree that it takes a tremendous amount of self-control to do that. <br />This is a person that times and again accuse me of &#8216;copying her work&#8217;, &#8216;disappointing skills&#8217;, &#8216;a waste of money&#8217;, &#8216;I&#8217;m basically doing your job for you&#8217;. And also several condescending attempts like asking me if I know a particular English word mean, which is pathetically ironic coming from a person who can barely speak English. If I was going to use the same tactic, I&#8217;d probably laugh hysterically every time she says the word &#8216;cross&#8217; (which is written as &#8216;courses&#8217; in all the document).<br />I guess she took it personal when I mentioned that what she&#8217;s doing is not the responsibility of a Product Analyst. She probably thought I was insinuating that she wasn&#8217;t a real Product Analyst. If this offended her, she probably thought so herself.<br />Everybody whoever worked with me knows that I never make personal attacks, ever. And this accusation is something that I absolutely cannot accept. Of all their spins, this is the most serious one, as it damages my personal reputation.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1631788258120" class="rank-math-list-item">
<div class="rank-math-question ">5. Regarding my inability to take Constructive Criticism</div>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>This one is laughable. I&#8217;m not sure which ones of their so called &#8216;criticism&#8217; that they could qualify as &#8216;constructive&#8217;. I don&#8217;t even know if they even qualify as criticism.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The most infuriating part is that after spewing all these craps, they had to audacity to accuse my company of poor screening before sending candidates their ways, and that they will have to be more careful with the interviewing process next time. The galls of these people.</p>



<h4 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading">Closing words:</h4>



<p>Being nice sucks, but sometimes you have no choice as an employee. Especially employee of an outsourcing company. I wonder if it&#8217;s high time I make my exit. Let&#8217;s give it a few more time and see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.back4app.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DigitalOcean-vs-Linode-2-1140x515.png" alt="DigitalOcean vs. Linode | Low-code backend to build modern apps" title="Choosing a cloud hosting provider: Digital Ocean vs Linode 2"></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m gonna make this short: avoid Digital Ocean like the plague.</p>



<p>As you know, my whole website used to be hosted on a VM Instance on Google Cloud Platform. However, the cost of GCP was a little much for my usage so I was looking to migrate to another provider. The most obvious names that comes to mind that wasn&#8217;t &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; (AWS, Azure, Alibaba, Google) are the holy trinity: Digital Ocean, Linode and Vultr (which I didn&#8217;t test).</p>



<p>Among those, Digital Ocean is probably the most well known name.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re everywhere. <br>They seem to have the best UI among the cloud provider (and I&#8217;m a sucker for good UIs). <br>They have a pretty extensive knowledgebase that covers pretty everything in tech. <br>They have a huge marketplace, pretty much every self hosted project you see has a &#8216;Deploy on Digital Ocean droplet&#8217; option.</p>



<p>DO sounds like a no-brainer. So I set out to create my account. Being a skeptical, naturally I sign up using a &#8216;trial&#8217; account that offer a $100 credit for 60-day, there&#8217;s plenty of those on Google if you search for it, but don&#8217;t make the same mistake as I did, the 60-day $100 is a goddamn lie. When I added my credit card, I was told there might be a $1 charge for verification that will be refunded in no more than a week. When I added my first droplet, I was immediately charged $6.15, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s never going to be refunded as a few weeks have passed. </p>



<p>This shady practice alone should be enough of a reason for most of you to avoid DO. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, there&#8217;s also the performance issue.</p>



<p>I created a nano droplet (the $5/m variant). You may ask why I decided to go for the bottom of the barrel choice even though I have $100 in trial credit. In my opinion, a service is only as good as its bottom line, and testing it should give a pretty good overview of the quality of the service being offered. And boy was that the correct decision.</p>



<p>Performance was good on the first day, but it only goes downhill from there. I have a total of 6 WordPress websites with virtually no traffic (only one of them has like 100 visits per DAY). And yet the droplet was slowed to near unresponsive level when I finished migrating my 4th website. SFTP would constantly timeout. If I try to visit 2 of my sites at the same time, the server would return a 504 error. It was unacceptable.</p>



<p>I was ready to give DO the benefit of doubt and blame the <a href="https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20210907/vietnams-internet-speed-crippled-by-cable-break/62983.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruption of AAE-1 international internet cable line</a> as a factor (even though the droplet I created was provisioned on the Singapore data center, which shouldn&#8217;t have been affected by that incident. </p>



<p>It was then that I decided to make an account on Linode and give it a shot. The sign up process was exactly the same but they didn&#8217;t even charge me a cent for verification. I fired up a $5 linode, going through the same migration process, and lo&#8217; and behold, everything just worked! All 6 websites up and running without a hitch. The hardest part of the migration was, ironically enough, caused by Digital Ocean. As the websites keep timing out when I try to create Duplicator packages. </p>



<p>Normally to save space on the droplet I&#8217;d make Duplicator send the packages to my Google Drive and my OneDrive Business storage, however on the DO droplet, they couldn&#8217;t even communicate with either Google or Microsoft server at all, forcing me to SFTP in and painfully try to download the package manually, bit by bit (thank god WinSCP can do that without poping up a dialog ever 5 minutes). The failure to communicate with Google and Microsoft&#8217;s server is a testament that the connection problem was with Digital Ocean and not with my ISP.</p>



<p>Anyway just wanted to share my experience. Obviously I&#8217;m not endorsing either Linode or Vultr yet since I&#8217;m only on a trial run with them, but one thing is definite: avoid Digital Ocean.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all for today, folks.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">I mean, fucking 2020, amirite? It was one hell of year, or hellish, might I say. Almost every living creature on this planet was affected one way or the other. Despite all the crazy shits that happened during the year, it wasn&#8217;t all bad. I&#8217;d like to take a step back and look at things now.</p>



<p>I know, I know, you&#8217;re probably asking &#8220;Dude, it&#8217;s almost March 2021 now, why the hell are you looking back at 2020 now?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ok first of all, according to the Lunar calendar, it&#8217;s only barely 2 weeks over January now, plus prior to it I had a shit ton of work I need to get done. I don&#8217;t even like doing look back posts like this, but something just happened that prompted me.</p>



<span id="more-14891"></span>



<p>I got a 2nd raise in a year.</p>



<p>Yay me, right? But that&#8217;s not what prompted me to write this blog. No, it&#8217;s a negative experience that occurred over half a year ago that just came back to haunt me as my LM mentioned it again during our talk.</p>



<p>I will rant about it in details later but first let&#8217;s take a look at what I actually managed to get done in 2020.</p>



<h3 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading">Personal Projects (DIY Builds):</h3>



<ul><li>Planned, purchased equipments and manually setup a complete home surveillance system on my own, complete with remote access on mobile devices. All for under $180 (after I was quoted $500 for the same system from a contractor) . This was prompted by my first break-in ever.</li><li>Recycled a tin chocolate box into a completely functional computer (which I&#8217;m in the process of turning into a Xpenology box)</li><li>Finished setting <a href="/2021/02/hosting-my-own-netflix-on-an-ancient-mac-mini-2011/" data-type="post" data-id="14873">my own media streaming server with remote access</a>, learned a lot about networking during the process.</li><li>Built a new computer (Ryzen 5 3600 + 32GB Neo Trident Z RAM + Galaxy 1070 8GB OC) &#8211; with a custom meshed front panel that I created myself.</li><li>Started work on the Bartop Arcade Cabinet project, hoping to have a working prototype before summer.</li></ul>



<h3 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading">Professional Projects (UI/UX Designs):</h3>



<ul><li><strong>A comprehensive media planning and management software for marketing professionals for a subsidiary of IPG MediaBrands, a giant in the media industry.</strong> A massive project which includes multi tenancy, regional reporting, online &amp; offline media scheduling and processing system. This project turned me into a morning person after having to wake up at 6 for conference calls with San Francisco. Unfortunately it was cut short by nCoV, but it was still a pretty interesting case study, which I will definitely do a writeup when I have more time (and clearance for showcasing the works, of course).</li><li><strong>A learning management system for my wife&#8217;s edtech startup: VuiHoc</strong>. A super exciting project aimed at K6 students. &#8220;Cute&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Colorful&#8221; was never my style but I managed to help getting the company off the ground, and it is now one of the force to be reckoned with in the industry here in Vietnam (probably No. 1 if you count only the bootstrapping startups)</li><li><strong>A virtual working space for a Japanese corporation, (whose name I am contractually obligated to not reveal until the product goes live).</strong> A super rushed project which I completed within a single week, but for some reason it became my most celebrated project of the year. Probably due to its sheer difficulty. The whole thing was done in a single week, designed, prototyped, and documented, in Japanese! (made possible only with Figma&#8217;s translation plugins, I will do a writeup on designing multilingual interfaces in Figma later if there&#8217;s any interest). With only me and a BrSE to support with translation, we worked around the clock and delivered a super satisfactory end product. The project implemented some very creative gamification approaches that I will document in another post.</li><li><strong>A car rental service iOS app by a startup funded by Jaguar-Range Rover</strong>, whose name I won&#8217;t be mentioning since I&#8217;m about to rant about them in a sec. It wasn&#8217;t a disaster or anything, I&#8217;m just a little unhappy about the way they handle things to avoid responsibilities toward the end. Despite that, I still got to meet and work with some amazing people, especially UX specialist like Ruko Kuga, so it&#8217;s still a win in my book.</li><li><strong>A bio sample management system for The Wellcome Sanger Institute, a non-profit British genomics and genetics research institute</strong>, part of the Darwin Tree of Life programme.</li></ul>



<p>Now, regarding the car rental project. Here&#8217;s an oversimplified version of what happened:</p>



<p>&#8211; &#8220;Hey Nam, pleasure to meet you!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;Thanks for the quick turnover Nam, you&#8217;re fast!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;Wow! These looks great Nam!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;That&#8217;s fabulous, Nam. Let&#8217;s go with that!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;Brilliant! Btw, we&#8217;re letting you go today, we already got another designer. Thanksie!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yep, just like that, saying I was caught off-guard was somewhat an understatement. To be clear, I wasn&#8217;t at all upset that it happened, and more or less saw it coming. Their CTO had been hinting about pressure coming down from upstair for weeks. I wasn&#8217;t at all surprised that they&#8217;d replace me with a local designer who understands the local car rental market better AND can jump on a call with them during work hours. No, what pissed me off was that they actually cited poor work quality as the reason for this abrupt change.</p>



<p>Now before you roll your eyes, let me just stop you right there. I know I&#8217;m not the greatest UI Designer in the world, but I do take great pride in my works, and I am very VERY open to constructive criticism, which I received none in this case. The client literally showered me with praises up until the day I was released from the project. If you ever been in a situation where you don&#8217;t know what you did wrong then you&#8217;d know how irritating it is. I strive to better myself every single day, and if there&#8217;s areas I could improve on, I want to know it, no matter how hard it is. So I pushed further for answers.</p>



<p>And guess what?</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t even the fucking reason!</p>



<p>Yep, the real reason was a political one. Turns out the new designer works for Jaguar Range Rover, and they wanted him on the team. The client, knowing they&#8217;d have to fork over a chunk of dough for the abrupt severance if they couldn&#8217;t somehow point the finger at us, so they fabricate some vague reasons for it.</p>



<p>I mean, I wasn&#8217;t that mad, their hands were tied after all. My wife also runs a startup and I know the massive pressure they get when the suits start poking their noses in the business. Still, the way they handled it was kind of a dick move, seeing how it could&#8217;ve affected my performance assessment at my company (which didn&#8217;t happen thankfully, my bosses kind of saw right through it, that&#8217;s why I like it here. That&#8217;s a life tip right there, only work for people who are smarter than you).</p>



<p>But anyway, it&#8217;s all behind now. Tbh I sorta forgot about it already, but it resurfaced once again in my yearly performance review so I had to vent it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So one of my fellow designer recently posted this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/XbF0i5k.png" alt="XbF0i5k" title="What is &quot;Creativity&quot;? 4"></p>
<p>Basically one of his client saidthis</p>
<blockquote><p>Using repetitive layout patterns in app design in order to improve learnability is just an excuse for being lazy at creativity.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that raises an interesting question (for me anyway): just what is &#8220;Creativity&#8221;, anyway?</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not talking about its literal definition, we all have our own intepretation of what it is. I&#8217;m talking about how we &#8211; the people in the design community &#8211; perceive it.</p>
<p>Graphic designers, product designers, illustrators, painters, UI/UX designers, visual GFX artists, game artists etc. we&#8217;re own thrown into the same blanket category: &#8220;Creatives&#8221; they call us. But that word, Creativity, it&#8217;s not the same thing for all of us.</p>
<p>For graphic designers, illustrators, painters&#8230;Creativity is a goal, the ultimate destination where you want to take your creations</p>
<p>For UI/UX/Product designers&#8230;Creativity is a tool, and as with any other tool, you only wield it to serve a purpose. And in our case, that purpose is Usability.</p>
<p>Think about it, if you&#8217;re an artists, a painter, your work doesn&#8217;t really serve anyone else but your own creators, and those who follow their visions. The ultimate validation of your works is its creativity.</p>
<p>But as a product designer, your work serves other purposes</p>
<p>In conclusion, to answer the question: is it bad if your creation is not super innovative?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say it depends on the purpose of your creation.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s for show, then yes</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s for use, then no.</p>

<p>No, you can&#8217;t make this shit up. You can actually read about it in this article on their piss poor excuse of a knowledgebase <a href="https://my.freenom.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>2005:<br />
Wasn&#8217;t particularly an eventful year.<br />
Lots of things hasn&#8217;t happened yet.<br />
The first iPhone wasn&#8217;t due for another 2 years.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t even in college, just a kid fresh out of High School.<br />
And yet one thing made that year particularly memorable to me, to all of my family.<br />
This guy right here.<br />
I still remember vividly the day he came into our lives, such tiny little creature, with piercing blue eyes. So small and yet nothing seems to be scaring him. Footsteps, loud noises, nothing could even make him turn his head.<br />
(We soon found out that&#8217;s because he&#8217;s completely, utterly deaf <span class="_47e3 _5mfr" title="smile emoticon"><img decoding="async" class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t4c/1/16/1f642.png" alt="1f642" width="16" height="16" title="Good bye Mr. Snowball 5"><span class="_7oe" aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></span> which is also why he never had a formal name, because nobody could&#8217;ve called him. He was simply known as &#8220;The Snowball&#8221;)<br />
Then he&#8217;d proceed to spend the next 14 years of his life brightening up our days, without fail.<br />
Today is no different really. After spending most of the days being awesome, he took a hearty meal from his favorite bow, went back to his favorite box, took a nap, and decided not to wake up again.<br />
Today is a beautiful autumn day. I guess if you could choose how and when to go, today is as good as any.<br />
Still, it&#8217;s never easy losing a friend who was with you for almost half your life.</p>
<p>2005-2019<br />
Rest in peace buddy, you may have left our lives, but you will never leave our hearts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hôm nay tình cờ lôi quyển hộ chiếu ra, phát hiện đã đến ngày hết hạn, tự nhiên nhớ lại cái ngày này đúng 10 năm về trước, cảm giác hân hoan khi nhận được nó vẫn còn như in.</p>
<p>Có nhiều thứ từ cách đây một thập kỷ mà mình ko còn có thể nhớ nổi nữa, nhưng cuốn hộ chiếu này thì mình vẫn nhớ như in, vì bối cảnh đặc biệt mà mình nhận được nó.</p>
<p>10 năm trước là kỷ niệm 60 năm thành lập hãng hàng không JetBlue, bọn nó dân chơi offer 1 cái deal cho phép mình mua 1 cái vé $600 có thể bay đến bất cứ sân bay nào mà JetBlue có hoạt động trong lãnh thổ US. Và đó là khởi đầu của tất cả, chuyến &#8216;road trip&#8217; đầu tiên trong cuộc đời, chuyến đi mở mang đầu óc đầu tiên. (trước thời điểm đó mình thuộc loại hardcore introvert, cả tháng chỉ có đến trường rồi về nhà chơi game, ko ra khỏi nhà, nếu không có bà chị lôi đi chuyến đi này chắc giờ mình vẫn tiếp tục lesor lắm).</p>
<p><span id="more-6097"></span></p>
<p>Vẫn nhớ lịch trình năm đó đi qua bao nhiêu thành phố, từ NY đến Orlando (lần đầu được đi Disney World), đến Hollywood, đến Santa Monica, rồi pha ngã để đời của bà chị ở Lombard St., SF làm suýt nữa phải đi cấp cứu. Nhưng chưa có lúc nào chuyến đi gần với việc kết thúc sớm như sự kiện xảy ra ở Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Theo lịch trình, 2 chị em rời Orlando, FL bay tới Puerto Rico vào ngày 13/09/2009. Đúng là ngày 13 có khác, tuy ko phải thứ 6 (Chủ Nhật nếu mình nhớ ko lầm). Thành phố thì thời tiết dễ chịu ngất ngây, nhưng về tới KS chưa kịp làm gì đã bị một cái tát vào mặt khi phát hiện ra để quên 1 cái túi trên taxi, trong đấy có 1 cái hộ chiếu và cái netbook của mình (back when netbooks are still a thing).</p>
<p>Phần tiếp theo thì mình ko nhớ rõ lắm, chắc do panic attack, mà panic cũng phải thôi, lần đầu đi roadtrip mà đã gặp phải phốt như vậy. Chỉ nhớ mơ hồ cảnh gọi về báo với bố mẹ mà bị mắng té tát, chắc đứng từ San Juan vẫn nghe được tiếng từ New York vọng xuống. Rồi mấy ngày tiếp theo 2 chị em bỏ hết lịch trình đi chơi để ngồi lỳ ở sân bay tìm xem có gặp lại thằng taxi đấy không. Mà khổ, bên Puerto Rico thời tiền Uber nó vận hành theo kiểu nhiều hãng taxi vận hành dưới cùng 1 banner, khác nhau mỗi cái đăng ký. Cách duy nhất để ID cái taxi đấy là tờ hoá đơn taxi, mà cái hoá đơn đấy nó ở luôn trong cái túi mình mất mới đau. Nói chung thời tiền taxi công nghệ có nhiều thứ bất cập mà bây giờ chúng ta taken for granted lắm.</p>
<p>Mà việc mất hộ chiếu bình thường vốn đã thốn, việc mất hộ chiếu khi đi roadtrip ở đất Puerto Rico nó còn thốn hơn. Thông thường khi bay lượn trong 50 bang chính thức của mẽo (bao gồm cả các bang vốn không dính liền vào &#8220;Hoa kỳ đại lục&#8221; như Alaska hay Hawaii) thì mình vốn chỉ cần show ID chứ ko cần hộ chiếu. Nhưng thằng PR nó oái oăm ở chỗ, tuy nó là lãnh thổ chưa hợp nhất của US (unincorporated land of the United States), nhưng khi di chuyển giữa PR và đại lục thì vẫn cần có hộ chiếu (có VISA US và I-84). Ngoài ra, vì mình đi vé anniversary của Jet Blue nên nó có 1 requirements là nếu yêu cầu huỷ/đổi chuyến thì phải thông báo trước 3 ngày nếu ko sẽ bị phạt thêm mấy trăm đô đó, ko nhớ lắm. Mà itinerary của mình ở PR có 3 ngày nên ko thể nào báo kịp, phen này xác định bị phạt cho tung đít rồi.</p>
<p>Để có thể tiếp tục chuyến roadtrip này, cách duy nhất là phải làm lại được quyển hộ chiếu VÀ xin được VISA US VÀ chuyển được quyển hộ chiếu đấy đến Puerto Rico trong 2 ngày. Một nhiệm vụ có thể nói là bất khả thi. Vậy mà mẹ mình làm được đấy. Mẹ mình tuy ác khẩu nhưng phải công nhận lúc cần thiết vẫn là superhuman. Tất tần tật việc xin phái đoàn làm hoả tốc lại 1 cuốn hộ chiếu, rồi phi sang phái đoàn US năn nỉ nó cấp cho 1 cái VISA, và ra FedEx hoả tốc xuống PR, tất cả mẹ mình chỉ làm trong có độc 1 ngày!</p>
<p>Tuy ko thể nào xin lại được cái form I-84 vì cái đó chỉ hải quan mới cấp được, nhưng bên cửa khẩu PR vẫn cho qua sau khi mình show được hình screenshot của tấm I-84 cũ (thanks god for the cloud).</p>
<p>Anyway, đó là câu chuyện của hơn 10 năm trước về việc tại sao mình sở hữu được 1 trong những cuốn hộ chiếu &#8220;của độc&#8221; tại Việt Nam mà có nơi cấp ở nước ngoài. Hồi mới về đi làm thẻ ngân hàng có bạn teller còn hồn nhiên hỏi mình &#8220;Anh là Việt kiều ạ?&#8221; trong khi cầm trong tay quyển hộ chiếu VN vỏ xanh của mình, chỉ vì cái dòng đó.</p>
<p>Nháy mắt 1 phát mà đã hết hạn rồi, nhanh thật. Ngẫm lại trong 10 năm ấy mình chưa gắn thêm được nhiều trang vào cuốn sổ của mình ngoài cái visa US và Đài Loan. Còn lại toàn các con dấu của các nước trong khu vực Đông Nam Á.</p>
<p>10 năm, trôi qua nhanh như 1 giấc mộng. Tự hỏi cuộc đời mình còn được mấy lần 10 năm nữa, và mình sẽ làm được gì.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m an loyal person, once I use a service, I tend to stick with it, even if the service quality goes down, I&#8217;d tolerate it.</p>
<p>But there comes a time when man must put his foot down and say &#8220;That&#8217;s enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the last month I&#8217;ve decided to switch services for many things that I&#8217;ve used for a long time:</p>
<h2>Mobile carrier:</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a faithful <strong>Mobifone</strong> user for as long as I have a cell phone, dating back all the way to 2005 I think when I got my first phone (a Motorola L7, I could still remember it vividly). But this month I&#8217;ve decided to switch to <strong>Viettel</strong>, they&#8217;ve come a long way, and is just better overall.</p>
<h2>Internet Service Provider:</h2>
<p>There aren&#8217;t really any different between the major ISPs here in Vietnam, every year they get pretty much the same amount of dreadful downtime. But recently, <strong>FPT</strong> was discovered to have shady pricing schemes with their customers, so now once again I&#8217;m sticking with <strong>Viettel</strong> as my main ISP.</p>
<p>Banking:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure most of you can relate to this one, you use <strong>Vietcombank, </strong>realize their service is completely and utter shit, but you still have to use them anyway, because your company pays your salary through them. It&#8217;s a common issue, nobody likes them, but everybody uses them, so they don&#8217;t give a shit. They burden their customers with all kinds of bullshit fees, treating them as if they&#8217;re a burden. Well, this last month my company managed an incredible feat: <strong>breaking free from Vietcombank</strong>. (or as I&#8217;d like to call it, relieving 2000+ accounts from their burden).</p>
<p>We switched to <strong>HSBC</strong> because it&#8217;s convenient for my UK-based firm, but really, their internet banking is a completely different beast. I&#8217;ve never since that kind of UX since, well, kindergarten. But that&#8217;s a story for another day.</p>
<h2>Remote Desktop:</h2>
<p>Just by uttering the word Remote Desktop you probably would&#8217;ve guessed what I&#8217;ve been using for the last 10 years, yes it was <strong>TeamViewer</strong>, I&#8217;ve been using them ever since their first days, when nobody even know who they are. While I&#8217;ve never been a paid customer, I believe I&#8217;d paid my due by being a super active evangelist. I&#8217;ve installed TeamViewer for everyone I know who might need help, I&#8217;ve showed a handful of people how to use it. I played my part in building up the popularity that they have today, and what do I get in return?</p>
<p>A big FUCK YOU is what.</p>
<p>My account was flagged as a &#8216;potentially commercial account&#8217;, and connection time was limited to 30 seconds. Yes you read that right, 30 fucking seconds! Holy mother fucking shit</p>
<p>Luckily, like with all things in life, eventually something better will come along and kick the shit out of it. In this case, that thing is called &#8220;AnyDesk&#8221;. Not only does it work so much more reliably, it also doesn&#8217;t leave a fucking nagging message after every session. Seriously, that thing annoyed the shit out of me.</p>
