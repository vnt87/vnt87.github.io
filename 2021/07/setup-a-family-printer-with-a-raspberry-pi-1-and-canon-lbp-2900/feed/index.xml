					<description><![CDATA[Hi all.
I followed step-by-step process but I&#039;m struggled with Adding new printer. 
Canon LBP2900 doesn&#039;t appears as LOCAL Printer.

Just 
CUPS-BRF (Virtual Braille BRF Printer)
 VNC Remote Printer (VNC Printer)
 HP Printer (HPLIP)

Any help to have the Canon LBP2900 listed in Local Printers?
Thanks in advance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well.. another bit of googling helped me out to realize that on a client Windows machine it&#039;s conditionally capable to operate under Microsoft PS Class driver (as a replacement for the original from Canon). What are those conditions? Reasonable question. But I sadly have nothing to reply. Either way, shall everything being set up this way, it allows you to print a signle page docs more or less successfully. Not mentioning that every one of them would be followed by a blank page &quot;printed&quot; (also have no idea why that&#039;s happening).
At the same time, any multiple sheets document is an absolutely impossible task to complete. At best, what you get would be its very first page printed (and a blank one the next minute of course!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any ideas on why it seems to be all-in-all accessible over the network but refuses all your attempts to make it print the jobs? If necessarily, I&#039;ll gladly provide any further details related to what I did/set/etc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Somebody says: &quot;I installed Canon LBP2900 on my Windows 10 machine successfully, but when I print, the app says:
The print server is down.
Check the print server.&quot;

I faced with the exact same issue as well. Answering your question yep I still can freely access to the Cups&#039; web GUI...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this article!
My Canon LBP2900 is almost working again.
Unfortunately, after every page printed, it prints a blank page and then needs to be resumed by pushing the blinking button on the printer device :-(.
Any idea how to fix this?]]></description>
