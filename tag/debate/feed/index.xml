										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So one of my fellow designer recently posted this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/XbF0i5k.png" alt="XbF0i5k" title="What is &quot;Creativity&quot;? 2"></p>
<p>Basically one of his client saidthis</p>
<blockquote><p>Using repetitive layout patterns in app design in order to improve learnability is just an excuse for being lazy at creativity.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that raises an interesting question (for me anyway): just what is &#8220;Creativity&#8221;, anyway?</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not talking about its literal definition, we all have our own intepretation of what it is. I&#8217;m talking about how we &#8211; the people in the design community &#8211; perceive it.</p>
<p>Graphic designers, product designers, illustrators, painters, UI/UX designers, visual GFX artists, game artists etc. we&#8217;re own thrown into the same blanket category: &#8220;Creatives&#8221; they call us. But that word, Creativity, it&#8217;s not the same thing for all of us.</p>
<p>For graphic designers, illustrators, painters&#8230;Creativity is a goal, the ultimate destination where you want to take your creations</p>
<p>For UI/UX/Product designers&#8230;Creativity is a tool, and as with any other tool, you only wield it to serve a purpose. And in our case, that purpose is Usability.</p>
<p>Think about it, if you&#8217;re an artists, a painter, your work doesn&#8217;t really serve anyone else but your own creators, and those who follow their visions. The ultimate validation of your works is its creativity.</p>
<p>But as a product designer, your work serves other purposes</p>
<p>In conclusion, to answer the question: is it bad if your creation is not super innovative?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say it depends on the purpose of your creation.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s for show, then yes</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s for use, then no.</p>
