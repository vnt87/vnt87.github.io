										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Houdini 17 includes a wealth of new features, including a GPU-accelerated multisolver for cloth, hair, soft bodies and grains, a new white water solver, a material-based destruction framework, facial autorigs, fullbody IK, enhanced animation and modeling workflows, UV autoseaming, GLTF I/O, gamedev tools and much more.</p></blockquote>
<p>You guys hear that, GPU-accelerated cloth engine! Looks like we won&#8217;t even need nCloth or Marvelous Designer in the future. I honestly don&#8217;t know how they do it, but every new release blows our friggin&#8217; mind, unlike Maxon&#8217;s releases, which takes a lot of concentration to spot the changes. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I still very much like Cinema4D, releases are still leaps and bounds better than Autodesk&#8217;s bug-ridden products, but it kinda hit a R&amp;D block for a few years now.</p>
<p>As far as Autodesk go, well I guess given their huge market share, they might stay relevant for a few more years, but if you want job security, I&#8217;d suggest to jump on the Houdini bandwagon as soon as possible. Houdini 16.5 has been going stable on my Deepin Linux box on first try, while Autodesk Maya <a href="/2018/08/17/installing-autodesk-maya-2018-update-3-on-deepin-linux-15-6/">took a lot more effort to install</a>, and even by some miracles you manage to get it to run, it wouldn&#8217;t last long, a simple graphic driver update (which is absolutely necessary) would break your installation easily. Face it, a company with decades operating in the industry and billions of dollar in the bank, still couldn&#8217;t get something as simple as that done, then it&#8217;s only a matter of time before people move on to better things.</p>
<p>Get Houdini today! (I&#8217;m not even getting paid for promoting it, it&#8217;s just that the team over at SideFX is just too awesome)</p>
