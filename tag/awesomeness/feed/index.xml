										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I have a bunch of old hard drives laying around. About 5-6 different hard drives of various capacities ranging from 1TB to 2TB, not counting the 2.5&#8243; drives. Looking at that pile, naturally the first thing that comes to mind is building a NAS. I was going to get a cheap Buffalo NAS for around $50 but then I realized I&#8217;d also need it to double as a workstation since I do need (I think &#8216;need&#8217; is the right word) a computer in my workshop</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the parts I used:</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Setup:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mobo: Lenovo MTQ45MK <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. $15</span></strong> <em>| salvaged from an old ThinkCentre M58, what I like is that unlike most OEM PCs, this mobo actually has 4 RAM slots, making it a lot cheaper to add more memories since 2GB sticks are dirt cheap.</em></p>
<p><strong>CPU: Intel Quad Q6600 <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. $8</span></strong> | <em>probably the best bang for the buck CPU you can get for socket 775, a quad-core processor that goes for under $10, with an amazing overclocking head room (not that we are going to be doing any OCing, but it&#8217;s nice the have the option)</em></p>
<p><strong>Memories: (x4) Kingmax 2GB DDR3 1333Mhz <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. $4/ea</span></strong> <em>| DDR3 memories are cheaper than dirt these days, plus you most likely have stick or two already lying around somewhere. I already 2 sticks so I only needed to order 2 more. If you want to meet FreeNAS minimum requirements, this is probably the cheapest way get at it, at $16 for 8GB.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-6084"></span></p>
<p><strong>PSU: Dell 350W <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. $8</span></strong> | <em>salvaged from my old XPS 8500 tower, its only down size is the very short CPU power cable, but luckily I got a spare extension laying around. I&#8217;d prefer to use the M58&#8217;s 260W if I had it, as that is still more than enough for our usage, but alas I have to make do with what I have.</em></p>
<p><strong>HDDs: 4TB <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. N/A</span></strong> <em>| as mentioned above, the reason we&#8217;re building this server is because I have a lot of old hard drives lying around, including a Hitachi Deskstar 1TB, a Seagate 1.5TB, a Western Digital Green 2TB and a few smaller drives. Many of these already had bad sectors so it&#8217;s not possible to price them correctly. I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;re building a NAS you must&#8217;ve had a few HDDs laying around already. If not, the price for traditional persistent storage are dirt cheap these days.</em></p>
<p><strong>Case <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. FREE</span></strong> <em>| you could barely call this case a </em></p>
<p><strong>Software setup: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 64-bit <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. FREE</span></strong> <em>| this hardware actually is capable of running Win10 but I&#8217;m not a big fan of the telemetry, not because of any ethical reason or anything, I just think any unnecessary services running in the background would consume more energy. If you wondering why I chose Windows instead of Linux, which is the more conventional choice for fileservers, the answer is simple: sync clients. I use a lot of different cloud services, like Google Drive, SugarSync, Mega.nz, Dropbox, Zoho Docs, Tencent Weiyun, Baidu Wangpan&#8230; you name it, I use it. Not all of them have sync clients for anything other than Windows. Sure there&#8217;s workarounds to get it work on Linux for each of them, but I simply don&#8217;t have time to poke around to get them to work. Windows simply plug and play, that&#8217;s what I need.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Tonido Home Server <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. FREE </span></strong><em>| best all around software to setup a home server with remote access. Far easier to setup than NextCloud, Tonido is pretty much plug and play.</em></p>
<p><strong>Google Drive File Stream <span style="color: #99cc00;">-est. $7</span></strong> <em>| bought a &#8220;lifetime&#8221; Google Drive Unlimited from a shady local school admin, still my best investment to date. I expected it to die after a month or 2. It&#8217;s been 2 years now and still going strong</em></p>
<p>So the setup is like this: this server is going to be my primary fileserver where everything, and I mean ~everything~ convenes. Every file I want to backup, on all of my computer and devices, and my wife&#8217;s, and my sister&#8217;s, and my parents&#8217;, they all can be backed up to this drive and is accessible from every devices we own! You might say it&#8217;s risky having a central file server like this where I don&#8217;t even have a RAID setup in place, what if the drives fail?</p>
<p>Well you aren&#8217;t wrong, this system was not designed to be a safe vault. In fact, most of the drives I use actually have bad sectors so it&#8217;s only a matter of time. That&#8217;s where the sync clients come in! The offsite backup is what makes this setup a true cloud setup. Everything I have will be gradually be backed up to my Google Drive with unlimited storage. All the other sync clients are only there to pull my files to this server. If I want to access my files on Dropbox for example, instead of having to install the sync client on every devices I own, I simply need to open up Tonido, go into the Dropbox folder on my fileserver and they&#8217;re all there. Isn&#8217;t that beautiful?</p>
