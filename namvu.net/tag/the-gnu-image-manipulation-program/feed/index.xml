										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After all these years, I&#8217;ve come to the fact that GIMP is now a lost cause. It used to be a &#8216;Photoshop alternative&#8217;, but after years of stagnation it&#8217;s now having its butt kicked by even another open source image editor (Krita).</p>
<p>Nonetheless it&#8217;s still one of my all-time favorite editor, mostly due to nostalgia&#8217;s sake (I was a well-known tutorial writer back in the 2000s for the GIMP, you know, back when written tutorials were still a thing). And I especially take joy in reworking its UI. This, I do admit, is due to that fact that its interface is so godawful that ANY changes you make to it is an improvement. Whenever I feel bored or depressed, I rework</p>
<p>I did a GIMP UI rework some odd years ago. The project never finished due to time constraints, as I had other obligations to attend to. But that was when designers were creating UIs on Photoshop (I shivers as I remember those times). I think I blew like a week on that project. Fun times, hah.</p>
<p>Times had changed. We have dedicated UI design tools these days. I spent like a few hours on Figma already have more progress than I did in a week with the last project. And this was done completely on Linux! Something that was impossible the last time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick sneak peak of the current WIP.</p>
<p><span id="more-6297"></span></p>
<p><strong>Feb 16 2020</strong>: Basic layout for the overall interface, dockable dialogs, tools etc.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Feb 18 2020</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Added sample artwork in main work area</li>
<li>Added ruler (man this would&#8217;ve been a bitch to work with if Figma didn&#8217;t implement Autoflow)</li>
<li>Dock the toolset to the left instead of letting it float (there will be a dual-column undocked version later)</li>
<li>Modify the text in the bottom info bar to resemble actual useful information</li>
</ol>

<p>(for future references, this is the screen we&#8217;re trying to redesign:</p>

<p>Also, for the record, my design is open source and can be freely accessed on Figma at <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/hWyVbX2yGHzpkO3R25Hpug/NeoGIMP?node-id=88%3A1082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this URL</a></p>
