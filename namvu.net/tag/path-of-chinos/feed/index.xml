										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So recently I sent an email to Grinding Gear Games regarding recovering an old guild that me and my friends created 4 years ago. It was a lengthy email explaining my situation. I was very disappointed when it was declined, not because my request wasn&#8217;t granted, but because the response I got was a generic response that was most likely generated by a bot. Back in the old days, any request sent to their support address was handled by actual human beings, and the whole experience feel human.</p>
<p>Now all I got are these trashy, automated responses</p>
<p>I used to think being bought out by Tencent was actually good for GGG&#8217;s future, boy, was I wrong. No wonder why people call this game Path of Chinos these days</p>
