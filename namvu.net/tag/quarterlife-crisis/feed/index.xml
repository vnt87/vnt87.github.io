										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="-en-clipboard: true;">So it&#8217;s been exactly 5 months since I last quit my old job, and I&#8217;ve yet to find a new one. Definitely did not think it&#8217;d be this tough to find a new job, I was over confident in my skills.</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve burned through the last of my unemployment check</div>
<div>My and my wife had burned through half of our savings trying to conceive a child (and bad coin investments).</div>
<div>So far all had been for naught, and we might need another 100 mil for IVF.</div>
<div>My dad still has kidney stones, might need surgery.</div>
<div>My mom&#8217;s leg is going bad, might need surgery. (Update: the diagnosis results came back, it is very possible my mom has lung cancer, just like my grandma. I wasn&#8217;t ready for this, but I have to)</div>
<div>If I don&#8217;t get a job some time this month, I&#8217;ll definitely be cutting into the rest of my saving.</div>
<div>I guess this is what you&#8217;d call rock bottom.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Is it time to abandon my passion as a graphic artist, and look for something else? Never thought this profession would be so treacherous, you get over 30 and suddenly you&#8217;re unwanted trash.</div>
<div>Is it time to abandon Hanoi? This backwater place has such an under developed industry that it appears to be content with operating without any decent graphic artist.</div>
