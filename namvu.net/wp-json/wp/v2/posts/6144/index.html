I&#8217;ve spent the last few weekends teaching myself around Google Cloud platform (and later on, Amazon Web Services). What I learned most from those experiences is that: my knowledge regarding networking and virtualization was close to non-existent and if anything, I need to go back to practice on a local environment where I have access to all the hardwares before I even think about dirtying my hands with cloud implementations.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s how I came to join\u00a0<em>r\/HomeLab<\/em> and subsequently\u00a0<em>r\/HomeServer<\/em>. Now I&#8217;ve been told before that these subs will more likely discourage you from building your own homelab rather than encouraging it, as they will make\u00a0<em>whatever<\/em> you build feel puny in comparison, but I didn&#8217;t expect some people to build a freaking datacenter in their garages. While many of those guys got the hardwares for free from work, I know some of those people dropped hundred of thousands dollar into hardware purchases. Homelabbing is, in a way, similar to photography or music or even toy collection, once it become a hardcore hobby it gets rather expensive.<\/p>\n<p>As a photographer I don&#8217;t feel like I can afford to sink my wallet into yet another expensive hobby, and as such I decided to do it my way, the thrifty, cheapskate way.<\/p>\n<p>Meet my Nam Vu home server, the cheapest, most ghetto machine you can imagine:<\/p>\n<p>Hardware specs:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Intel Core2Quad Q6600 @3.0Ghz (tapemodded) ~$5<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Lenovo MTQ45NK Motherboard ~$15<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 4x2GB DDR3 1333Mhz Memory ~$12<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 320GB Toshiba HDD ~$13<\/p>\n<p>This machine will be dual booting Proxmox 6 and Windows 10 LTSC.<\/p>\n<p>Why bother having Windows when you can have it running under Proxmox you ask? Well I need Windows for a lot of different applications (like sync clients for many cloud storage services), plus the Remote Desktop feature blows TeamViewer and AnyDesk out of the water. And for those applications I want the best performance I can get, which is hardly achievable if you run it under a hypervisor with this ghetto hardware.<\/p>\n<p>Now Proxmox doesn&#8217;t recommend dual booting with anything, in fact its default installer ISO doesn&#8217;t even include an option for you to partition your drive, so if you want a dual boot configuration your only hope is to setup Debian to run along side Windows first, and then installing Proxmox VE on top of Debian. I will be covering the steps in my next posts, they are fairly simple to setup at first but there&#8217;s a couple of issues that you might run into along the way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My often spend my scarce free time teaching myself new things (when I don&#8217;t feel like DIYing useless shits).
