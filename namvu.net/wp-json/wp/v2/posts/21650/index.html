For starter, it only runs from 8am to 11.30pm everyday, mainly because I hosted it from my personal desktop, which is only powered on during those period. Another drawback of running it from my personal PC is the lack of space. I only had a single 3TB HDD installed, and Phimhub&#8217;s library had long exceeded that. I tried to work around it by using Google Drive File Stream (now simply known as Google Drive) to keep only a fraction of the files offline, and leave the rest on the cloud. This effectively means that only around 30% of Phimhub&#8217;s library was ready to play at any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21651\" srcset=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-1024x768.png 1024w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-1536x1152.png 1536w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-2048x1536.png 2048w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-67x50.png 67w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-650x487.png 650w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-1000x750.png 1000w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-50x37.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"\"><figcaption>So much room for activities!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today I&#8217;m proud to say those annoyances should be gone. I&#8217;ve finished building a DIY NAS running Xpenology with a whopping 64TB of storage (2x WD Ultrastar 16Tb, 2x Seagate Exos 16Tb, all enterprise class, datacenter ready drives). I&#8217;ve also procured a more powerful laptop to act as the resident server, hosting every single services in one place (containerized of course). A bump from N3060 to an i5-4200M means now I can move Jellyfin to the laptop itself instead of running it from my PC. While the i5 does consume quite a bit more power than the Celeron (37w vs 6w), but it&#8217;s still better than running my power hungry desktop PC for 16 hours a day for sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, instead of hosting Jellyfin AND the media library on my own PC, now Jellyfin will be moved into a docker container on my laptop server, and the media library will reside on the family NAS. You do need to mount the SMB share as a local mount on your server of course. One drawback of this approach is that you can no longer delete media from the Web UI, since I didn&#8217;t give the docker container write permission to the SMB share. I could do that but I figure it&#8217;s better this way, since I&#8217;ll be the only one managing the media files anyway, I can just do it from my local computer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As you may know, I run a little movie club, which started out as a Netflix group buy a year ago, which later led to me setting up my own [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2022\/01\/phimhub-major-update\/\" class=\"more-link style2-button\">Read More<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ghostkit_customizer_options":"","ghostkit_custom_css":"","ghostkit_custom_js_head":"","ghostkit_custom_js_foot":"","ghostkit_typography":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[299],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/21650"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=21650"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/21650\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":21654,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/21650\/revisions\/21654"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=21650"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=21650"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=21650"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
