One of my worries when switching to Manjaro is software availability (or lack thereof). Most pre-packaged softwares on Linux comes in either Debian flavor (.deb) or Red Hat flavor (.rpm), and Manjaro is well, neither. It&#8217;s Arch-based.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, its user repo is pretty massive. I was able to find almost everything I wanted on AUR (Arch User Repository), and pretty much everything is up-to-date, unlike Deepin&#8217;s shitty &#8216;App Store&#8217;. Proprietary softwares however, are harder to come by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them is Bootstrap Studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was super relieved however, to learn that the developer chose to release the linux binary as an AppImage as opposed to DEB or RPM. Which means it&#8217;s super convenient to work with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it&#8217;s electron-based, it basically uses the same binaries for Windows, OS X and Linux. So if you wanted to, you can replace <code>app.asar<\/code> with the same file from another platform and it would just works\u2122.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you want to do that? Well if you&#8217;re here then chances are you already know why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you basically want to do is grab the AppImage, run it with the flag <code>--appimage-extract<\/code>, which will extract everything to a folder called <code>squashfs-root.<\/code> Just go in there, replace the file, then repack everything with the command <code>appimagetool -v squashfs-root<\/code> and you will have what you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just don&#8217;t tell anybody about this, m&#8217;kay?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just installed Manjaro KDE Plasma today after Deepin 20 totally let me down.
