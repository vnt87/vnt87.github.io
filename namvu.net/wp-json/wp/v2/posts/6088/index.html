But this month I&#8217;ve decided to switch to\u00a0<strong>Viettel<\/strong>, they&#8217;ve come a long way, and is just better overall.<\/p>\n<h2>Internet Service Provider:<\/h2>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t really any different between the major ISPs here in Vietnam, every year they get pretty much the same amount of dreadful downtime. But recently, <strong>FPT<\/strong> was discovered to have shady pricing schemes with their customers, so now once again I&#8217;m sticking with <strong>Viettel<\/strong> as my main ISP.<\/p>\n<p>Banking:<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure most of you can relate to this one, you use\u00a0<strong>Vietcombank,\u00a0<\/strong>realize their service is completely and utter shit, but you still have to use them anyway, because your company pays your salary through them. It&#8217;s a common issue, nobody likes them, but everybody uses them, so they don&#8217;t give a shit. They burden their customers with all kinds of bullshit fees, treating them as if they&#8217;re a burden. Well, this last month my company managed an incredible feat: <strong>breaking free from Vietcombank<\/strong>. (or as I&#8217;d like to call it, relieving 2000+ accounts from their burden).<\/p>\n<p>We switched to <strong>HSBC<\/strong> because it&#8217;s convenient for my UK-based firm, but really, their internet banking is a completely different beast. I&#8217;ve never since that kind of UX since, well, kindergarten. But that&#8217;s a story for another day.<\/p>\n<h2>Remote Desktop:<\/h2>\n<p>Just by uttering the word Remote Desktop you probably would&#8217;ve guessed what I&#8217;ve been using for the last 10 years, yes it was\u00a0<strong>TeamViewer<\/strong>, I&#8217;ve been using them ever since their first days, when nobody even know who they are. While I&#8217;ve never been a paid customer, I believe I&#8217;d paid my due by being a super active evangelist. I&#8217;ve installed TeamViewer for everyone I know who might need help, I&#8217;ve showed a handful of people how to use it. I played my part in building up the popularity that they have today, and what do I get in return?<\/p>\n<p>A big FUCK YOU is what.<\/p>\n<p>My account was flagged as a &#8216;potentially commercial account&#8217;, and connection time was limited to 30 seconds. Yes you read that right, 30 fucking seconds! Holy mother fucking shit<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, like with all things in life, eventually something better will come along and kick the shit out of it. In this case, that thing is called &#8220;AnyDesk&#8221;. Not only does it work so much more reliably, it also doesn&#8217;t leave a fucking nagging message after every session. Seriously, that thing annoyed the shit out of me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m an loyal person, once I use a service, I tend to stick with it, even if the service quality goes down, I&#8217;d tolerate it.
