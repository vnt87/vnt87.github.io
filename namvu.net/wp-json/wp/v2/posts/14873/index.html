You want to know how I set it up. Read on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple really, I bought a used Mac Mini 2011 for around $40 back in 2018. It has a what I believe a 3rd gen core i5 and 6GB of DDR3 SODIMM RAM. I know it is a potato, but it consumes about 85W at full load so I can leave it running 24\/7 instead of my Ryzen rig. Originally it only serves as a media player for my wife to watch movies on FPT Play, HayHayTV, PubVN, MotPhim, etc. on our cheapo Asanzo TV (some of these services only run on a browser so Kodi doesn&#8217;t cut it, need to be a fully functional OS). She only watches for around 2 hours each night, yet the thing is running 24\/7, it would a complete waste of electricity if I don&#8217;t somehow find a way to make it useful for the rest of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where Jellyfin came in. A few simple setups and you can now watch movies store on this little potato.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically there&#8217;s only 4 steps involved:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Download, install and run Jellyfin server<\/li><li>Populate your media library with whatever movies\/TV shows you have<\/li><li>Install Caddy and run the command below<\/li><li>Point your domain DNS to your home&#8217;s public IP<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I got the reverse proxy up, bind it to my domain WITH a valid SSL with a single command:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"shell\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">caddy reverse-proxy --from example.com --to 127.0.0.1:8096<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>(Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/jellyfin.org\/docs\/general\/networking\/caddy.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/jellyfin.org\/docs\/general\/networking\/caddy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jellyfin documentation on Caddy<\/a> if you need further information) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re done!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, since I&#8217;m running the server from my bedroom, there&#8217;s still the issue with dynamic IP address. Viettel is not exactly the most reliable ISP so I get random modem reboot every couple of days. Everytime it happens I&#8217;d need to log into CloudFlare and manually change the DNS to my new public IP address. That is a pain indeed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily there is a way to automate this process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">Running a cronjob to update your domain&#8217;s DNS every hour.<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need a machine running 24\/7 for this task.

And it was great, unbelievably so for a free software. I was able to get my entire library up and running in no time, the UI looks slick (which for an interface designer like me, is a huge plus), and remote access works out of the box (provided of course, you have port forwarding properly setup on your router). But after using it for a couple of days, I decided to scrap it and go with Jellyfin, a lesser known media server solution. There&#8217;s 2 things that bothered me with Plex:<br><br>\u2022 <strong>Plex is a lot less &#8216;free&#8217; than you thought.<\/strong> You may not need a Plex Pass to enable Remote Access on your own server, but can you really freely access it remotely is a huge asterisk. To clarify, accessing it remotely from the web client is entirely free with no restriction whatsoever. BUT accessing your Plex server from its mobile app is going to cost you, either in the form of the Plex Pass or in the case of the Android app, a one time payment of $5, which I paid, but still moved on anyway. Why? Because of the next point.<br><br>\u2022 <strong>Plex has started invading your personal library with their own contents.<\/strong> While the contents they offer aren&#8217;t exactly bad (I do love me some classic Popeye the Sailor Man), the way they populate their content in your own server makes it utterly confusing to end user to differentiate between Plex&#8217;s content and your own. Most people who self-host stuffs tend to be pretty anal about having a setup exactly the way they want it, I&#8217;m no exception.<br><br>As for Emby, I&#8217;ve heard good things about it, but I also heard it&#8217;s more or less the same as Plex, right down to the premium pricing strategy, so I went ahead and skip it.<br><br>Installed Jellyfin and was absolutely pleased with it, everything just works out of the box, and all the platform apps are free. As a strong supporter of the free software movement, it&#8217;s a no brainer for me. Plex and Emby couldn&#8217;t win me back even if they offer Plex Plass or Emby Premiere for free now.<\/p><\/span><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-faq-child uagb-faq-child__outer-wrap uagb-block-e0ee3da3\"><div class=\"uagb-faq-child__wrapper\"><div class=\"uagb-faq-item\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"uagb-faq-questions-button uagb-faq-questions\"><span class=\"uagb-icon uagb-faq-icon-wrap\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 448 512\"><path d=\"M416 208H272V64c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32h-32c-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32v144H32c-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32v32c0 17.67 14.33 32 32 32h144v144c0 17.67 14.33 32 32 32h32c17.67 0 32-14.33 32-32V304h144c17.67 0 32-14.33 32-32v-32c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"uagb-icon-active uagb-faq-icon-wrap\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 448 512\"><path d=\"M416 208H32c-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32v32c0 17.67 14.33 32 32 32h384c17.67 0 32-14.33 32-32v-32c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"uagb-question\">Why use your own domain instead of a Dynamic DNS service like DynDNS or MyDNS.vn?<\/span><\/div><div class=\"uagb-faq-content\"><span><p>To be honest, for home use, there&#8217;s no real good reason.

The only thing the reverse proxy is good for in this use case is so you can easily bind your domain to the exact address + port combination on your server, and add a SSL to it so users don&#8217;t have to remember the port number everytime they need to access your library. So instead of going to <em>172.191.1.255:8096<\/em> and be greeted with a big fat warning about unsecure connection (if they are using a modern browser), your users can just visit yoursite.domain and boom, they&#8217;re in business, much like going to Netflix.<br>You could potentially get around the port issue by somehow running on Jellyfin on port 80 (default http port) or something. But on UNIX systems like Linux and OS X you need elevated access to run services on port below 1024, which means you have to manually start the service each time your machine start.

But setting nginx up is a daunting task in itself. My Mac Mini is 2011 which means it&#8217;s stuck with High Sierra, meaning almost all Homebrew package now needs to be built from source. That&#8217;s easy enough but there&#8217;s still the issue with setting nginx up and running on restricted port which I mentioned above. You need nginx on port 80 if you want to use any AutoSSL script like acme.sh or certbot. That involves editing some config file and I absolutely detest nginx config format. <br>Caddy on the other hand, well it just works. One single command and it gets your reverse proxy up, bind your domain to your port, AND auto secure it with a SSL.
