The guy was selling it for $20 a piece. Normally I&#8217;d just scroll past that but I for some reasons I was feeling especially low-bally that day so I asked, half-jokingly, if he&#8217;d be willing to part way with some of them for $10 a piece. To my surprise, he actually said yes. I guess he probably bought a shipment from China thinking it was some kind of SFF workstations. Anyway, long story short, I now have 4 Wyse thin clients that I don&#8217;t know what to do with.<\/p>\n<p>Or do I really?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to get into building a homelab, and this just give me more motivation to do it. While I do have a home &#8216;lab&#8217;, I don&#8217;t really have a real home server to put inside it. I had an old Q6600 antique that I use from time to time to watch DIY videos but let&#8217;s face it, it can never cut it as a real home server.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m thinking of building a dual xeon server with a healthy amount of RAM as a central server, running Proxmox or ESXi, serving the thin clients that I will be distributing around the house. So far I think I could replace my father&#8217;s, mother&#8217;s, my wife&#8217;s and maybe even my workshop current computer with a simple thin client. Not only does this setup saves a lot of space downstairs, it may actually provide a performance boost for my parents as they&#8217;re current using very old computers.<\/p>\n<p>Xeons are super cheap these days, as do ECC RAM modules. The only pricey part is perhaps, the motherboard.<\/p>\n<p>(to be continued&#8230;)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently came across a sale post on facebook for a number of decommissioned Wyse thin clients.
