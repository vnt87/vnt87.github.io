The first foreign movie to ever take home that gold statue.<\/p>\n<p>As an Asian, this news made me profoundly proud, but from an academic point of view, I am somewhat disappointed that Parasite won. Don&#8217;t get me wrong there, it&#8217;s a fantastic movie, and it deserves this title more than any of the Best Picture winners in the last 10 years.<\/p>\n<p>But this year? I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always thought the first foreign movie to take home the golden statue for Best Picture would be something along the line of Forrest Gump, or Inception, something that blows everyone&#8217;s mind everytime time you rewatch it, something that you remember forever as one of the greatest movie ever made. Parasite, while being an exceptional movie, is definitely not something that you&#8217;d remember in a few years time.<\/p>\n<p>And you can&#8217;t use the &#8216;but there&#8217;s no better movie released this year&#8217; to justify its win either.<\/p>\n<p>Competing against Parasite this year is 1917, the one-take movie that would probably go down in history as one of the greatest masterpieces ever made. Literally everyone who was lucky enough to experience it in the theater confirmed that it is the greatest cinematic experience they have ever had in their entire lives, and that is to put it lightly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In case you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, you must&#8217;ve heard about Parasite, the critically acclaimed movie from Korean director Bong Joon-ho, who just took home the highest honor at [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2020\/02\/oscar-2020\/\" class=\"more-link style2-button\">Read More<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ghostkit_customizer_options":"","ghostkit_custom_css":"","ghostkit_custom_js_head":"","ghostkit_custom_js_foot":"","ghostkit_typography":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6295"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6295"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6295\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6295"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6295"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6295"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
