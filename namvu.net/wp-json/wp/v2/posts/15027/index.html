The User-Centered Design Process"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>UCD is one of the term that gets thrown around alot recently, with businesses putting more emphasis on UX in their products. But just because it&#8217;s used a lot, doesn&#8217;t mean everybody fully understands what that is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">User-centered design process<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Each phase of the user-centered design process focuses on users and their needs. It\u2019s an iterative process, which means that designers go back to certain phases, again and again, to refine their designs and create the best possible product for their intended users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the core of the user-centered design process is a deep empathy for the user. It\u2019s not just about what a product does for a user, it\u2019s about how the experience of interacting with the design makes the user <em>feel<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the key steps in the user-centered design process:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Understand how the user experiences the product<\/strong>. You want to know how users will engage with your design, as well as the environment or context in which they\u2019ll experience the product. Understanding this requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews, which we\u2019ll explore more later.<\/li><li><strong>Specify the user\u2019s needs<\/strong>. Based on your research, figure out which user problems are the most important to solve.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Design solutions<\/strong>. Come up with lots of ideas for designs that can address the user problems you\u2019ve identified. Then, start to actually design those ideas!&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Evaluate the solutions you designed against the user\u2019s needs<\/strong>. Ask yourself, does the design I created solve the user\u2019s problem? To answer this question, you should test the product you designed with real people and collect feedback.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-1024x390.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15045\" srcset=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-1024x390.png 1024w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-768x292.png 768w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-1536x585.png 1536w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-2048x779.png 2048w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-131x50.png 131w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-650x247.png 650w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-1000x381.png 1000w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ucd-50x19.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice how the arrows in the diagram indicate circular movement. This illustrates the iterative quality of the user-centered design process. Designers go back to earlier phases of the process to refine and make corrections to their designs. With the user-centered design process, you\u2019re always working to improve the user\u2019s experience and address the problems that users are facing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Guiding principles for the user-centered design process<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Design for users and their needs. <\/strong>It can be tempting to design something in a certain way because it looks cool or solves one of your own problems, but it\u2019s essential to keep in mind that you are <em>not<\/em> the end user. You&#8217;re designing to help a diverse set of humans with specific needs.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Make your copy conversational. <\/strong>The writing within your product design should have a friendly, simple, and easily accessible tone. Avoid jargon or overly-complicated terminology that users might not understand.<\/li><li><strong>Present all information clearly. <\/strong>Users should be able to navigate your product design easily and without assistance from others. Make key information, like checkout buttons, simple to find and identify.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Acknowledge user actions. <\/strong>Your product should let users know when they\u2019ve executed a task correctly. That might be as simple as having a new window pop up when an icon is pressed, or as complex as animated tossed confetti to demonstrate that the user has accomplished a task.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Offer support. <\/strong>As UX designers, our goal is to make designs accessible and understandable to every user, but sometimes we fall a bit short. Offer users a safety net, like a support center or list of Frequently Asked Questions. Make sure a frustrated user doesn\u2019t have to swipe and click all over the product to find help.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also important to have empathy for yourself and your design team throughout the user-centered design process. When you\u2019re trying to improve the user experience, you\u2019ll inevitably fail at some point. That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s disappointing when a design fails, but there\u2019s no reason to feel defeated. Learning from that experience will give you the tools and the understanding to try again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: <\/strong>UCD is, in essence, a core UX design framework that <a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2021\/06\/common-ux-design-frameworks-design-thinking-process-and-the-five-elements-approach\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15022\">other UX design frameworks<\/a> are based on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UCD is one of the term that gets thrown around alot recently, with businesses putting more emphasis on UX in their products.
