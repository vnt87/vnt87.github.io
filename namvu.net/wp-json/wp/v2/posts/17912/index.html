You\u2019ve already learned about the problems that can come up when designers make assumptions about their users and their needs. So how do you avoid making those assumptions? By doing research! In this reading, you\u2019ll explore some common research methods used by UX designers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Types of research<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to categorize research: <em>who conducts<\/em> the research and the <em>type of data<\/em> collected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first way to categorize research is based on whoconducts the research: primary research and secondary research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Primary research<\/strong> is research <em>you<\/em> conduct yourself. Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Secondary research<\/strong> is research that uses information <em>someone else <\/em>has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second way to categorize research is based on the type of data collected: qualitative or quantitative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Qualitative research<\/strong> is primarily collected<em> through observations and conversations<\/em>. Qualitative research is based on understanding users\u2019 needs and aims to answer questions like \u201cwhy\u201d or \u201chow did this happen?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quantitative research<\/strong> focuses on data that can be <em>gathered by counting or measuring<\/em>. Quantitative research is based on numerical data that\u2019s often collected from large-scale surveys. This type of research aims to answer questions like \u201chow many?\u201d and \u201chow much?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AWPPz96.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All four of these types of research can intermix. Primary and secondary research can be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, an interview is <em>qualitative <\/em>research. An interview conducted by you is <em>primary <\/em>research. If you review an article about an interview conducted by someone else, it\u2019s <em>secondary <\/em>research. It\u2019s important to be able to identify the difference between these types of research because the data you collect forms the basis of your design decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Primary research methods<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand the different types of research, let\u2019s review some common primary research methods for gathering information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/apJ3b0y.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interviews <\/strong>are a research method used to collect in-depth information on people&#8217;s opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Interviews can be performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews can take the form of qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative research method includes open-ended questions that require participants to explain their answers by providing more details.&nbsp;A quantitative research method includes only close-ended questions, like questions that require only \u201cyes\u201d&nbsp; or \u201cno\u201d responses or set multiple choice questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best practice is to conduct at least five user interviews during your research. As you conduct your interviews, you\u2019ll start to find similarities in the feedback that users provide about what works and what doesn\u2019t work about your product. This is exactly the kind of feedback you want!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Advantages<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You\u2019re better able to understand what a user thinks and why.<\/li><li>You can adjust your questions or refocus the discussion based on the user\u2019s answers.<\/li><li>You have the ability to ask follow-up questions in real time.<\/li><li>You have the ability to ask questions specific to a user\u2019s needs.<\/li><li>You\u2019ll receive direct suggestions from the user.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It\u2019s time-consuming to interview each user.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It\u2019s expensive to pay participants and to rent space for the interviews.<\/li><li>The sample sizes are smaller, due to time and money constraints.<\/li><li>Group interviews can be affected by the bandwagon effect, or going along with the group\u2019s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn\u2019t align with the majority of the group.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about interviews, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/user-interviews\/#:~:text=Topics%3A,of%20learning%20about%20that%20topic.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>an article about user interviews<\/u><\/a> from the Nielsen Norman Group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sUGgdPU.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>survey <\/strong>is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product. Surveys are a great way to measure the success of your product, during development and after it\u2019s launched. For example, sending surveys after a product is released can help you measure the effectiveness of your product and provide a foundation for future improvements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can design surveys to include open-ended questions for qualitative research, which allow research participants to clarify their survey responses, as well as close-ended questions for quantitative research, which generate numerical data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Advantages<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You can learn more from a larger sample size.<\/li><li>You are able to gather results and insights quickly.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Surveys are usually inexpensive because they don\u2019t take as much time for participants to complete, and they can be done remotely.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Surveys often do not allow for in-depth feedback; most questions will have responses drawn from a set of multiple-choice answers.&nbsp;<\/li><li>There are some types of research questions that won\u2019t work in a survey format.<\/li><li>Surveys usually do not allow for personalization.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about surveys, check out usability.gov&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usability.gov\/how-to-and-tools\/methods\/online-surveys.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>article about online surveys<\/u><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vLjbm1u.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>usability study <\/strong>is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users. Usability studies help demonstrate if a product is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted. There are lots of ways to test usability, both in person and online. It\u2019s a good idea to record your usability sessions, either audio or video, so you can reference the user data as you make design decisions later on in the process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualitative research is based on observations, and a critical part of conducting usability studies is observing how participants interact with the product you\u2019ve designed. Focusing on qualitative research during usability studies can generate more personal insights by assessing the behavior of users as they experience the product. Quantitative research can also be used when conducting usability studies to understand participants\u2019 impressions of the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Advantages<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You can learn from first-hand user interaction and observation.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Usability studies can challenge your assumptions about your product by demonstrating a completely different result than you were expecting.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Users can provide in-depth feedback.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Usability studies only measures how easy it is to use a product.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This type of research can be expensive, especially if it\u2019s conducted in person.&nbsp;<\/li><li>There can be differences between a \u201ccontrolled\u201d usability study in a lab versus how a user experiences the product in their real life.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about usability tests, check out the Nielsen Norman Group&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/usability-testing-101\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>article on usability testing<\/u><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Secondary research methods<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondary researchcan be completed at any phase of the project, since you\u2019re using information from outside sources.
