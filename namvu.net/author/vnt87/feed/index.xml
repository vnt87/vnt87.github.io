Yes, Please</figcaption></figure>



<p>We (our family) have been using VNPT as our primary ISP for years. They are the largest ISP in Vietnam and generally we have been happy with their services. That rapidly changed during the last year. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s my list of complaint with VNPT:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unreliable Connection:</strong> constant disconnection and inability to access the CDNs of some of the most popular websites including Shopee, Facebook, TikTok (as of Mar 2023, only Shopee is still affected, and mostly during night time). This started to become a problem around Covid19 lockdown time, they probably had a customer base explosion and their infrastructure couldn&#8217;t keep up. I get it, but 2 years? Letting that lasting as long as it does is a clear sign of incompetency.</li>



<li><strong>Website Blocking:</strong> so they have this habit of straight up disabling access to certain websites, completely without their customer&#8217;s consent. I don&#8217;t have a comprehensive list of blocked websites but it include most of the pornographic websites like Pornhub, Xvideos etc. which I guess can&#8217;t be helped because they were mandated by the government (FPT also blocks these). But they also block 2 websites that doesn&#8217;t serve any adult content at all: <a href="https://medium.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medium </a>(where most of the UX editorial articles reside), and most recently, <a href="https://www.behance.net/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behance </a>(where people come for UI showcases when Dribbble shots don&#8217;t cut it). Naturally, you can see why I, as an UI/UX Designer, would have a major problem with this. I don&#8217;t want to have 1.1.1.1 running at startup just because I&#8217;m using a pussy ass ISP.<br>Now to be clear, FPT doesn&#8217;t block Medium and Behance, I have checked. And yes, I am aware that the lawmakers who are responsible for these blocks are incompetent short-sighted pieces of shit but remember, it was us (the people), who allow these people to hold these positions. So in the end it&#8217;s essentially our fault. My expectation for government officials of a developing country like VN was already extremely low to begin with but&#8230;holy shit.</li>



<li><strong>Shit Equipment:</strong> VNPT provided a 2-port modem on their first installation. Yep you read that right, 2-fucking-port excluding the WAN port. You can plug in a computer and a NAS and&#8230;that&#8217;s about it. You can of course phone up customer support and ask for a 4-port version, which I did, but com one. If they&#8217;re gonna cheap out on end users like that, what else are they cheaping out in the back? Perhaps that&#8217;s why their connection keeps going on and off intermittently. And also, the firmware on these modems though, holy shit I&#8217;ve probably haven&#8217;t seen such shitty software since the 90s, perhaps because they were probably made during that time. The UI <em>and</em> UX was straight up 90s-esque. They were ugly as shit and unintuitive to use. Took me way too long (and a lot of help from the WiFi community group on FB) to figure out which part do what. Who the fuck refer to port forwarding as &#8216;virtual server&#8217; really?<br>Anyway by the time I switched to FPT, the WebUI console of the VNPT modem has become completely inaccessible. Some kind of SSL error blocks access to it completely. I could probably phone up customer support for the 100th time and let them send another technician my way. But I&#8217;ve decided the next time I&#8217;m picking up the phone and calling them, it&#8217;d be for informing them that I&#8217;m dumping them.</li>
</ul>



<p>For reference, for the same price I&#8217;m paying ($10/mo) I&#8217;m getting more or less the same speed (150Mbps) on FPT <em>but</em> with a free Android box and a subscription to their TV service FPT Play. (VNPT also has MyTV, but it doesn&#8217;t come with the internet package). This puts FPT values way above VNPT even for the base package. But things start to get interesting once you get to the next package tier. For an additional $2/mo, FPT buffs your downstream speed all the way to Gigabit! That&#8217;s absolutely crazy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Keeping up with the latest tech/tools/terminology in the AI space is incredibly exhausting right now. It feels like every other week there&#8217;s a decade worth of development going on. I&#8217;ve never seen anything move at this speed since the dotcom era.</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you GPT it?&#8221; have officially replaced &#8220;Have you Google it?&#8221; when people ask each other any sort of question now (at least for those around me at least). And that is saying a lot. Anybody who grew up in the 90s and early 2000s remember how &#8216;Google&#8217; became a verb. It took them a few years and it was already considered incredibly fast back then. GPT just did that in a matter of months.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s plenty of debate/discussion to be had regarding this tech of course, but for me I feel like those who rally against it are exactly like the traditional Xe Ôm driver before the arrival of ride hailing apps, or the radio operators before the rise of television, or the teachers of the past who organized protest against the use of calculator. Love it or hate it, it is something that will change world forever, and it&#8217;s here to stay.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1988: Math teachers protest against calculator use.<br>2023: Teachers protest against ChatGPT use. <a href="https://t.co/DyuBysIZgZ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/DyuBysIZgZ</a></p>&mdash; Diego Castro (@HeyImCastro) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeyImCastro/status/1634192761892077569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Anybody remember when this tweet went viral just a few years back? Who&#8217;d think that less than 2 short years later it&#8217;s already changed. I often say to my friends that in addition to Googling, they need to list &#8220;prompt writing skill&#8221; in their resume as well. It often incites a laugh or a chuckle but I&#8217;m dead serious. You don&#8217;t want to take a backseat in this revolution unless you want to become obsolete.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got a CV today and the guy literally listed one of his skills as ‘googling’ <br><br>We’re interviewing him</p>&mdash; Cat McGee | catmcgee.eth/lens (@CatMcGeeCode) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatMcGeeCode/status/1418592423865950212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 23, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Time for an update</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things that I believe will become obsolete in a year or even less:</p>



<ul>
<li>Content writer/planner. <a href="https://vnexpress.net/bi-tru-tien-cong-vi-su-dung-chatgpt-4579479.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vnexpress.net/bi-tru-tien-cong-vi-su-dung-chatgpt-4579479.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Might have happened already</a>.</li>



<li>Tour guides. <a href="https://vnexpress.net/du-lich-theo-chatgpt-hay-nhan-vien-khach-san-4582598.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vnexpress.net/du-lich-theo-chatgpt-hay-nhan-vien-khach-san-4582598.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Article</a>.</li>



<li>Coders/Programmers. Not all of them of course, but only the outstanding ones will be left.</li>



<li>Renderers (as in V-ray, Redshift, Thea etc.). This one might be around for a while, but their days are numbered. Just look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPqJUrfKuqs" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPqJUrfKuqs" rel="noreferrer noopener">this shit</a>.</li>

<p>As an avid Portainer user and a UI designer, I just want to give a shout out to whoever worked on Portainer 2.15&#8217;s new UI facelift. They truly did a great job. Not only does it LOOK better, it actually addresses some of the minor annoyance that existed in the old UI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2.15-ui-home-comparison.gif" alt="2.15 ui home comparison" class="wp-image-21872" title="Shout out to Portainer.io for the UI facelift 6"><figcaption>Environment Page comparison</figcaption></figure>

<p></p>



<p>Now to be clear, the old UI wasn&#8217;t trash or anything, it was pretty okay, but it wasn&#8217;t GREAT. And while it didn&#8217;t affect the way Portainer works, there were some minor visual bugs that bother UI designers and/or hardcore nitpicking perfectionists, and I just happen to be both.</p>



<p>Take the App Templates page for example. In the old version, there were no constraints set for the app icons, and since they come in all shapes and sizes, they often get stretched and distorted beyond recognition, making the page looking very amateurish.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s no longer the case</p>

<p>Authelia is an authentication gateway. You only need to sign in once and you&#8217;ll get access to the whole server, but it&#8217;s not really SSO. You still need separate accounts for their respective applications. Still, having an additional layer of security in front of your services does provide peace of mind, especially when you combine it with Duo Security as a MFA method.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s many reverse proxies out there, like Traefik and Caddy, which is actually what I started it. But I choose NPM due to its simplicity. Sure Traefik and Caddy may offer more fine tune controls and is more suitable for power users, but NPM just works<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> with minimal configuration. It also handles SSL (via Let&#8217;s Encrypt) and its default configuration covers most of my need.</p>

<p>This is it, this is what sent me down this self-hosting rabbit hole. Those who followed me would remember that I run a small movie club called Phimhub, and I started out with a WordPress website much like namvu.net, that listed (NOT hosted) a number of interesting movie titles for our group. Much to our dismay Google, in their infinite wisdom, decided they didn&#8217;t like the site and axed my account (no specific reason given). So I did what any reasonable person would do, and host my own media server, with blackjack and hookers.</p>



<span id="more-21789"></span>



<p>I initially made the foolish mistake of choosing Plex, even went as far as purchasing a Plex pass for Android, before realizing I&#8217;m effectively running an ads platform WHILE paying them to shove ads into my face. The transition to Jellyfin was quick and painless. It&#8217;s perfect by any mean, as there&#8217;s a lot of technical debt leftover from the Emby codebase that people are working hard to work around, but it&#8217;s definitely the best among the current available media servers.</p>

<p>DSM gives you a file manager, a Docker manager (although far inferior to Portainer), a Download manager (with torrent support), photo viewer, camera monitor, system monitor and analysis tools, and tons of other addons. You could even deploy a full LAMP stack, or a Tailscale node. It&#8217;s the main reason why I don&#8217;t have Nextcloud installed on my server even though it&#8217;s massively popular among selfhosters. It&#8217;s the only one in this list that isn&#8217;t free and opensource, and the legalities around the bootloader is questionable, but I can&#8217;t give two shits about that, I just use whatever work best.</p>

<p>Almost everything I run is containerized with Docker, and with over 30 containers running on 3 different machines, it&#8217;s nice to have a GUI to manage them from a single place. I choose Portainer due to its ease of use, and better UI than <a href="https://yacht.sh/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://yacht.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yacht</a>. For personal use I recommend deploying the Business Edition since it&#8217;s free for 5 users for less. Honestly I don&#8217;t notice any difference between it and the Community edition, but they splatters the Community version with ads for the BE so I just went with it.</p>

<p>When it comes to server monitoring, many people opt for options like Grafana, which admittedly looks amazing if you spend enough time playing with it. For people that just want something that works<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, NetData is an awesome tool. A single install command one-liner and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>

<p>In reality though, I find myself using btop over SSH a lot more than netadata, but I do like having something that doesn&#8217;t require a client, which brings us to the next one.</p>

<p>Guacamole allows you to open a SSH or VNC or even RDP session to any computer on the network right from the browser (ie. clientless, as you don&#8217;t need a SSH or VNC client to use it, just a browser). Needless to say this is something that I imagine most sefl-hosters would not need, or even wanted in their service stack</p>

<p>I have 5 websites on my Linode VPS, plus over 2 dozens other services that I selfhost on various place. Needless to say I&#8217;m not able to check all of them on a daily basis. Luckily there&#8217;s a tool that does that for me. This pairs very nicely with #17 (gotify) for mobile push notifications. Even without Gotify, you can already push your notifications to dozens of service like Telegram, Mattermost, Whatsapp etc.</p>

<p>So my cheapo Chinese analog CCTV system relies on Internet Fucking Explorer to operate, and to add insult to injury it requires an old NPAPI plugin to boot. With Windows trying hard to kill off IE, I have to find a different solution to view my camera feed. RTSPtoWeb is the perfect solution for this, not to mention it integrates well with #13 Home Assistant</p>

<p>App dashboards are a dime a dozen among self-hoster, mainly due to how easy it is to setup. There&#8217;s literally dozens of apps in this category: Heimdall, Homer, Dashy, Flame just to name a few. But not all of them are configurable from the frontend. Some of them requires you to fuck around with either a YAML file or something else. I just go with the least complicated one, Heimdall, which allows you to add apps from the front end and even pull some data from the ingrated app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are two key parts to every UX design project: conducting research to learn about the users you’re designing for, and gathering feedback about their perspectives. UX design is all about putting the user first, and research helps designers understand those users.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>UX research</strong> focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions. UX research aligns what you, as the designer, <em>think</em> the user needs with what the user <em>actually</em> needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember the product development life cycle from an earlier course of the program? The <strong>product development life cycle</strong> has five stages — brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch — that take an idea for an app, website, or product to its launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s check out how research fits into the product development life cycle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/JHw9ulJ.png" alt="JHw9ulJ" title="About UX Research 27"><figcaption>About UX Research 31</figcaption></figure>



<span id="more-21750"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/PlnIgEj.png" alt="icon of a person holding a magnifying glass; text reads: foundational research" title="About UX Research 28"><figcaption>About UX Research 32</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Foundational research</strong> is always done <em>before</em> you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens during the brainstorm stage (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make personas and user stories, which you&#8217;ll learn about soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In foundational research, your goal is to figure out what the user needs and how to address those needs with your product. Strong foundational research can contradict your personal perspective on what a good solution might be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Questions you might consider during foundational research include:</p>



<ul><li>What should we build?</li><li>What are the user’s problems?</li><li>How can we solve those problems?</li><li>Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?</li></ul>



<p>There are lots of research methods for conducting foundational research, but many of them are based on observations. Common foundational research methods include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interviews:</strong> A research method used to collect in-depth information on people&#8217;s opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.</li><li><strong>Surveys:</strong> An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.</li><li><strong>Focus groups:</strong> A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design. A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Competitive audit:</strong> An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You&#8217;ll conduct your own competitive audit later in the course, so you will understand this research method well!&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Field studies:</strong> Research activities that take place in the user&#8217;s context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Diary studies:</strong> A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/X3SCz9i.png" alt="icon of a profile of a head with tools and icons coming out of the top; text reads: design research" title="About UX Research 29"><figcaption>About UX Research 33</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Design research</strong> is done <em>while</em> you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In design research, your goal is to answer the question: How should we build it?</p>



<p>The amount of design research you conduct will vary depending on where you work and what you’re building. The most common method used to conduct design research is a <strong>usability study</strong>, which is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal of usability studies is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the product launches. You’ll conduct your own usability study in the next course of this certificate program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additional research methods that might be used to conduct design research include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>A/B testing</strong>: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. For example, you might have users evaluate two layouts for the homepage of your app to find out which layout is more effective.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cafe or guerrilla studies:</strong> A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. For example, you might sit in a local coffee shop and ask customers if they would be willing to test your app design for a couple of minutes and provide feedback.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Card sorting: </strong>A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project, which we’ll discuss in the next course of the program — Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Designs.</li><li><strong>Intercepts: </strong>A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/htAJImN.png" alt="icon of a rocket ship in front of a laptop screen; text reads: post-launch research" title="About UX Research 30"><figcaption>About UX Research 34</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Post-launch research</strong> is done <em>after</em> the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help validate that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.</p>



<p>In post-launch research, your goal is to answer the question: Did we succeed? This research will tell you how your final product is performing based on established metrics, such as adoption, usage, user satisfaction, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should use research methods that give insight into what the user thinks of your product and if their experience using your product aligns with how you intended it to function. Research methods you might use to conduct post-launch research include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>A/B testing</strong></li><li><strong>Usability studies</strong></li><li><strong>Surveys</strong></li><li><strong>Logs analysis:</strong> A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The key to a user-focused product: Research</h2>



<p>Research is crucial to creating a product that satisfies users. As an entry-level designer, it might be tempting to assume what the user needs based on your own experience, but as you know: The user comes first. Always make sure that your opinions are backed up by your research. You should get feedback from your users before, during, and after you design!</p>

<p>If you recall I actually <a href="/portfolio/audacity-interface-redesign-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-schema-attribute="mentions">attempted to touch on this subject once in the past</a>. That was back when I still used Photoshop for UI design, so that little screenshot took me like 3 days or something. Today I&#8217;m attempting to do it again but in Figma and see if I could do something similar in 3 hours.</p>



<p>What if Audacity has a theme that used the same design language as Apple&#8217;s Logic Pro X?</p>
