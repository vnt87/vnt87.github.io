While that didn&#8217;t come as a surprise since they were pressured by our government for a while already, what did come as a surprise is their choice of provider: Moca.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\nI thought for sure they were misspelling <a href=\"https:\/\/momo.vn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Momo <\/a>or something, as it stands they are the largest digital wallet app in Vietnam as we speak, and is an obvious choice if you&#8217;re looking for a service like that. Surely Grab, a multi billion dollar company wouldn&#8217;t choose a non established name right?\n\n\n\n\n\nBut nah, they gonna go with Moca, a name most people have never even heard before in their life. But that&#8217;s ok, competition is always good for the end users, provided that the competition is, well, competitive. Let&#8217;s go ahead and check them out. A quick google search bring me to their homepage:\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"373\" class=\"wp-image-5664 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/image-1024x373.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/image-1024x373.png 1024w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/image-300x109.png 300w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/image-768x280.png 768w, https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/image.png 1034w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"\"><figcaption>What the fuck is this shit?

But surely you can&#8217;t judge a mobile app by the absolutely pitiful look of their desktop website.
