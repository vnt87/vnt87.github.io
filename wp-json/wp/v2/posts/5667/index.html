I believe these fears are coming from a good place &#8211; a monoculture certainly is not desirable, and a persistent challenge from competitors keeps tech at its best. Compounding this news was also a link floating around stating that&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/netmarketshare.com\/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-12%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-11%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mozilla Firefox was staring at a market share of below 9%<\/a>. What gives me pause, however, is that much of the advocacy for Firefox seems to stem from the fact that it\u2019s not Chrome. The pure logic of such a strategy is clear, but is it particularly convincing as a technique?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking more broadly for a moment, we as a society apply a lot of pressure on people to do stuff &#8211; to save the planet, and make the world a better place, and all the rest of it. Much of it is advocated through what I would describe as almost \u2018fear-based\u2019 language &#8211; kind of \u201cdo x or y will happen\u201d type scenarios. To be fair, much of it is set up that way. There\u2019s no real selfish benefit to e.g recycling, its pretty much about the altruism. In fact, if you read the news,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2018\/oct\/08\/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the stakes are pretty high it would seem<\/a>. For me, the conversation around Firefox strays too close to these heavy ultimatums. I think this kind of conversation is naturally fatiguing, and creates a particularly negative means of ushering new users into the platform &#8211; almost as hostages, rather than excited participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time we analyse what Firefox does better than Chrome, and sing those praises. For instance, it\u2019s arguably easier to avoid tracking with Firefox if that\u2019s your speed. I\u2019m sure there are other things &#8211; does Firefox beat Chrome out for speed? Or is it better featured in some areas? Perhaps Firefox is lacking things; I\u2019ve been using WebSockets a lot recently, and Chrome\u2019s frame-by-frame view of a WebSocket connection is invaluable. As far as I\u2019m aware, Firefox doesn\u2019t have this (yet). These aren\u2019t concrete suggestions, but maybe ideas of where the conversation can go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think about Chrome\u2019s usurping of Internet Explorer (IE), and I wonder (antitrust and all aside) would Chrome have usurped IE if it wasn\u2019t for IE stagnating? I remember when I was younger and jumped ship to Chrome &#8211; personally, it wasn\u2019t about using Chrome because it wasn\u2019t IE, it was about Chrome beating IE in a foot race and offering me a clean user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox is a fantastic browser, and the need to grow its market share is more pressing than ever. By making people excited to use Firefox rather than wary of using Chrome, I believe we can more effectively galvanise support for Firefox, and improve the health of the browser \u2018market\u2019 all round.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the news about&nbsp;Edge switching to a foundation using Chromium&nbsp;a lot of the conversation has centered on browser engines slipping into something of a monoculture.
