It was one hell of year, or hellish, might I say. Almost every living creature on this planet was affected one way or the other. Despite all the crazy shits that happened during the year, it wasn&#8217;t all bad. I&#8217;d like to take a step back and look at things now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, I know, you&#8217;re probably asking &#8220;Dude, it&#8217;s almost March 2021 now, why the hell are you looking back at 2020 now?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok first of all, according to the Lunar calendar, it&#8217;s only barely 2 weeks over January now, plus prior to it I had a shit ton of work I need to get done. I don&#8217;t even like doing look back posts like this, but something just happened that prompted me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>I got a 2nd raise in a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yay me, right? But that&#8217;s not what prompted me to write this blog. No, it&#8217;s a negative experience that occurred over half a year ago that just came back to haunt me as my LM mentioned it again during our talk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will rant about it in details later but first let&#8217;s take a look at what I actually managed to get done in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Personal Projects (DIY Builds):<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Planned, purchased equipments and manually setup a complete home surveillance system on my own, complete with remote access on mobile devices. All for under $180 (after I was quoted $500 for the same system from a contractor) . This was prompted by my first break-in ever.<\/li><li>Recycled a tin chocolate box into a completely functional computer (which I&#8217;m in the process of turning into a Xpenology box)<\/li><li>Finished setting <a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2021\/02\/hosting-my-own-netflix-on-an-ancient-mac-mini-2011\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14873\">my own media streaming server with remote access<\/a>, learned a lot about networking during the process.<\/li><li>Built a new computer (Ryzen 5 3600 + 32GB Neo Trident Z RAM + Galaxy 1070 8GB OC) &#8211; with a custom meshed front panel that I created myself.<\/li><li>Started work on the Bartop Arcade Cabinet project, hoping to have a working prototype before summer.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Professional Projects (UI\/UX Designs):<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A comprehensive media planning and management software for marketing professionals for a subsidiary of IPG MediaBrands, a giant in the media industry.<\/strong> A massive project which includes multi tenancy, regional reporting, online &amp; offline media scheduling and processing system. This project turned me into a morning person after having to wake up at 6 for conference calls with San Francisco. Unfortunately it was cut short by nCoV, but it was still a pretty interesting case study, which I will definitely do a writeup when I have more time (and clearance for showcasing the works, of course).<\/li><li><strong>A learning management system for my wife&#8217;s edtech startup: VuiHoc<\/strong>. A super exciting project aimed at K6 students. &#8220;Cute&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Colorful&#8221; was never my style but I managed to help getting the company off the ground, and it is now one of the force to be reckoned with in the industry here in Vietnam (probably No. 1 if you count only the bootstrapping startups)<\/li><li><strong>A virtual working space for a Japanese corporation, (whose name I am contractually obligated to not reveal until the product goes live).<\/strong> A super rushed project which I completed within a single week, but for some reason it became my most celebrated project of the year. Probably due to its sheer difficulty. The whole thing was done in a single week, designed, prototyped, and documented, in Japanese! (made possible only with Figma&#8217;s translation plugins, I will do a writeup on designing multilingual interfaces in Figma later if there&#8217;s any interest). With only me and a BrSE to support with translation, we worked around the clock and delivered a super satisfactory end product. The project implemented some very creative gamification approaches that I will document in another post.<\/li><li><strong>A car rental service iOS app by a startup funded by Jaguar-Range Rover<\/strong>, whose name I won&#8217;t be mentioning since I&#8217;m about to rant about them in a sec. It wasn&#8217;t a disaster or anything, I&#8217;m just a little unhappy about the way they handle things to avoid responsibilities toward the end. Despite that, I still got to meet and work with some amazing people, especially UX specialist like Ruko Kuga, so it&#8217;s still a win in my book.<\/li><li><strong>A bio sample management system for The Wellcome Sanger Institute, a non-profit British genomics and genetics research institute<\/strong>, part of the Darwin Tree of Life programme.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, regarding the car rental project. Here&#8217;s an oversimplified version of what happened:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; &#8220;Hey Nam, pleasure to meet you!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;Thanks for the quick turnover Nam, you&#8217;re fast!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;Wow! These looks great Nam!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;That&#8217;s fabulous, Nam. Let&#8217;s go with that!&#8221;<br>&#8211; &#8220;Brilliant! Btw, we&#8217;re letting you go today, we already got another designer. Thanksie!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, just like that, saying I was caught off-guard was somewhat an understatement. To be clear, I wasn&#8217;t at all upset that it happened, and more or less saw it coming. Their CTO had been hinting about pressure coming down from upstair for weeks. I wasn&#8217;t at all surprised that they&#8217;d replace me with a local designer who understands the local car rental market better AND can jump on a call with them during work hours. No, what pissed me off was that they actually cited poor work quality as the reason for this abrupt change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now before you roll your eyes, let me just stop you right there. I know I&#8217;m not the greatest UI Designer in the world, but I do take great pride in my works, and I am very VERY open to constructive criticism, which I received none in this case. The client literally showered me with praises up until the day I was released from the project. If you ever been in a situation where you don&#8217;t know what you did wrong then you&#8217;d know how irritating it is. I strive to better myself every single day, and if there&#8217;s areas I could improve on, I want to know it, no matter how hard it is. So I pushed further for answers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess what?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t even the fucking reason!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, the real reason was a political one. Turns out the new designer works for Jaguar Range Rover, and they wanted him on the team. The client, knowing they&#8217;d have to fork over a chunk of dough for the abrupt severance if they couldn&#8217;t somehow point the finger at us, so they fabricate some vague reasons for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I wasn&#8217;t that mad, their hands were tied after all. My wife also runs a startup and I know the massive pressure they get when the suits start poking their noses in the business. Still, the way they handled it was kind of a dick move, seeing how it could&#8217;ve affected my performance assessment at my company (which didn&#8217;t happen thankfully, my bosses kind of saw right through it, that&#8217;s why I like it here. That&#8217;s a life tip right there, only work for people who are smarter than you).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, it&#8217;s all behind now. Tbh I sorta forgot about it already, but it resurfaced once again in my yearly performance review so I had to vent it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#rantover<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I mean, fucking 2020, amirite?
