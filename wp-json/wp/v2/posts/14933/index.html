Personally I&#8217;d rank them like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Great tier: Google Cloud Platform<\/strong>, $300 trial credit for 12 months, reasonable pricing. Realistically you&#8217;ll probably get around 10 months out of your trial if you provision your VM correctly). UI is a bit confusing but overall usable.<br><em>Very transparent about pricing, even has a toast message showing your remaining fund and trial period. Doesn&#8217;t charge you a cent after your trial period ends, it just turns off your VM(s)<\/em>.<\/li><li><strong>Meh tier: Microsoft Azure<\/strong>, $200 trial credit for 12 months, worse pricing. While 200 doesn&#8217;t seem to be that much worse than Google&#8217;s offering, in reality it is a LOT less due to the higher pricing of VM provisioning. I burned through that $200 in around 3 months. The UI is more intuitive than GCP though.<br><em>Less transparent about your trial period than GCP, but still doesn&#8217;t charge you a cent after your trial period ends, it just turns off your VM(s)<\/em>.<br>Alibaba cloud is somewhat similar, I haven&#8217;t used it that much to have a solid opinion, but on paper it should be on par with Azure. Will update later.<\/li><li><strong>Trash tier: Amazon Web Service<\/strong>. Shitty UI, took me longer than all other services when it come to spinning up a VM, and even when it&#8217;s up and running, configuring networking to connect to it was challenging. I gave up after a few days of trying, and then kind of forgot about it. When I come back after a year, I was surprised to see my account suspended for &#8216;unpaid bills&#8217;.
