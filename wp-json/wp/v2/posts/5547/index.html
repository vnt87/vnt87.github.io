Looks like we won&#8217;t even need nCloth or Marvelous Designer in the future. I honestly don&#8217;t know how they do it, but every new release blows our friggin&#8217; mind, unlike Maxon&#8217;s releases, which takes a lot of concentration to spot the changes. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I still very much like Cinema4D, releases are still leaps and bounds better than Autodesk&#8217;s bug-ridden products, but it kinda hit a R&amp;D block for a few years now.<\/p>\n<p>As far as Autodesk go, well I guess given their huge market share, they might stay relevant for a few more years, but if you want job security, I&#8217;d suggest to jump on the Houdini bandwagon as soon as possible. Houdini 16.5 has been going stable on my Deepin Linux box on first try, while Autodesk Maya <a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2018\/08\/17\/installing-autodesk-maya-2018-update-3-on-deepin-linux-15-6\/\">took a lot more effort to install<\/a>, and even by some miracles you manage to get it to run, it wouldn&#8217;t last long, a simple graphic driver update (which is absolutely necessary) would break your installation easily. Face it, a company with decades operating in the industry and billions of dollar in the bank, still couldn&#8217;t get something as simple as that done, then it&#8217;s only a matter of time before people move on to better things.<\/p>\n<p>Get Houdini today! (I&#8217;m not even getting paid for promoting it, it&#8217;s just that the team over at SideFX is just too awesome)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From the description: Houdini 17 includes a wealth of new features, including a GPU-accelerated multisolver for cloth, hair, soft bodies and grains, a new white water solver, a material-based destruction [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2018\/10\/houdini-17-banshee-sneak-peek\/\" class=\"more-link style2-button\">Read More<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"video","meta":{"ghostkit_customizer_options":"","ghostkit_custom_css":"","ghostkit_custom_js_head":"","ghostkit_custom_js_foot":"","ghostkit_typography":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[299],"tags":[359,360],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5547"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5547"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5547\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5547"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5547"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5547"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
