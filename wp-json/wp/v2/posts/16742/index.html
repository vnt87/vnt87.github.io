Feeling like you aren\u2019t good enough to do a certain job or mingle with certain people happens to more people than you might think. In fact, feeling this way is so common that it even has a name: impostor syndrome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impostor syndrome<\/strong> is the belief that you\u2019re unskilled, inferior to others, or bad at your job, despite your successes. We\u2019ve all felt impostor syndrome at some point in our lives. If you\u2019re feeling impostor syndrome, you\u2019re certainly not alone!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YhebYBq.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Effects of impostor syndrome<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Impostor syndrome can cause anxiety and low confidence that can stop you from becoming the most successful version of yourself. Impostor syndrome can manifest in many ways, and each person\u2019s experience is unique. You might have seen or personally experienced impostor syndrome in situations like:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Not applying to jobs unless you meet every requirement (even though you totally don\u2019t have to!).<\/li><li>Taking on extra work to make sure you\u2019re \u201cdoing it all\u201d and to look more capable in front of your peers.<\/li><li>Not attending networking events or career fairs because you\u2019re nervous or anxious.<\/li><li>Downplaying your abilities during conversations.<\/li><li>Shrugging off compliments because you don\u2019t believe them.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Manage impostor syndrome<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ySPqdCv.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We want you to meet new people with confidence and without letting impostor syndrome get in the way. Here are a few pro tips to manage those anxious feelings:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Acknowledge your thoughts.<\/strong> Recognize how you\u2019re feeling, and try to pinpoint why you\u2019re feeling that way. This will help you figure out what triggers your impostor syndrome, so that you can better manage it in the future.<\/li><li><strong>Own your accomplishments. <\/strong>You have your own unique perspectives and experiences. Think of all of the accomplishments and skills that make you different from the next person. Write them down in a list so that you can see just how much you have to talk about when you network. You have plenty to offer, so go into conversations with confidence!<\/li><li><strong>Be honest with yourself. <\/strong>Do a realistic evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses. Finding areas that create the feeling of not \u201cbeing good enough\u201d and working to improve them will help you feel more confident in yourself. <em>Everyone<\/em> has areas where they can improve, and there\u2019s always more to learn, so don\u2019t let your weaknesses hold you back.<\/li><li><strong>Have a conversation.<\/strong> Ask a trusted mentor, friend, or seasoned professional how they handle impostor syndrome.<\/li><li><strong>Wear something that makes you feel confident.<\/strong> Looking good helps you feel good. If you\u2019re going to an in-person networking event, put on your favorite professional attire so that you feel like the best version of yourself.<\/li><li><strong>Help someone else. <\/strong>Sharing the knowledge that you have with others helps you feel more valuable. This could be giving advice to someone less experienced than you or sharing a unique experience with one of your peers. If you think you don\u2019t have anything to offer anyone else, refer back to the list you made earlier.<\/li><li><strong>Fake it till you make it. <\/strong>Even if you don\u2019t feel confident in your abilities as a designer, if you <em>act <\/em>confident for long enough, eventually it will become second nature to you. People are naturally drawn to confident individuals, so acting confidently will likely help you make even more connections within your workplace and the UX community.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Go with a friend.<\/strong> Attending networking events with someone you know can help you feel less overwhelmed and nervous.<\/li><li><strong>Get to know people.<\/strong> Becoming more familiar with other UX professionals will make you feel less out of place. You\u2019ll come to realize that experienced UX designers aren\u2019t as intimidating as they may initially seem! This will help you feel less nervous in the future when you meet other people.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Know that you&#8217;re not alone.<\/strong> If you\u2019re going to a networking event, or you\u2019re starting a group project with people you don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t be the only one who feels they don\u2019t belong. Being around experienced professionals can be intimidating, even if you\u2019re one yourself! Plus, even the most experienced UX designers were once in your shoes. We all started somewhere.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking and growing your career is all about learning, <em>not<\/em> about being perfect. Don\u2019t hold yourself to unreasonable standards. Instead, work to be the best designer you can be, be confident in who you are, and keep growing!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever felt like you aren\u2019t quite good enough, even though you actually are?
