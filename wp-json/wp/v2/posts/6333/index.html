I&#8217;m talking about how we &#8211; the people in the design community &#8211; perceive it.<\/p>\n<p>Graphic designers, product designers, illustrators, painters, UI\/UX designers, visual GFX artists, game artists etc. we&#8217;re own thrown into the same blanket category: &#8220;Creatives&#8221; they call us. But that word, Creativity, it&#8217;s not the same thing for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>For graphic designers, illustrators, painters&#8230;Creativity is a goal, the ultimate destination where you want to take your creations<\/p>\n<p>For UI\/UX\/Product designers&#8230;Creativity is a tool, and as with any other tool, you only wield it to serve a purpose. And in our case, that purpose is Usability.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it, if you&#8217;re an artists, a painter, your work doesn&#8217;t really serve anyone else but your own creators, and those who follow their visions. The ultimate validation of your works is its creativity.<\/p>\n<p>But as a product designer, your work serves other purposes<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, to answer the question: is it bad if your creation is not super innovative?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say it depends on the purpose of your creation.<\/p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s for show, then yes<\/p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s for use, then no.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So one of my fellow designer recently posted this: Basically one of his client saidthis Using repetitive layout patterns in app design in order to improve learnability is just an [&hellip;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/namvu.net\/2020\/04\/what-is-creativity\/\" class=\"more-link style2-button\">Read More<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ghostkit_customizer_options":"","ghostkit_custom_css":"","ghostkit_custom_js_head":"","ghostkit_custom_js_foot":"","ghostkit_typography":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[297],"tags":[632,631],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6333"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6333"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6333\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":21632,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6333\/revisions\/21632"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6333"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6333"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/namvu.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6333"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
