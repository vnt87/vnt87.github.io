The best way for you to create great user experiences is to know and empathize with your user. As you might recall, <strong>empathy <\/strong>is the ability to understand someone else\u2019s feelings or thoughts in a situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a UX designer, empathizing with users enhances the products you create because you experience the product as your user does. The better you are at anticipating a user\u2019s desires and needs, the more comfortable the user will feel with your design, and the more likely they will be to engage with your product long-term.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let\u2019s explore how empathy can make you a more effective UX designer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">How to empathize with users<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>If empathizing with users sounds like a big task, fear not! The ability to empathize with users is a skill that can be learned with practice. Here are six tips that can help you become a more empathetic UX designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HkHYY13.png\" alt=\"Icon of question marks, next to heading: Ask lots of questions\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask lots of questions. <\/strong>As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users\u2019 perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uQ14gnt.png\" alt=\"Icon of a video camera, and a heading that reads &quot;Become more observant&quot;\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Become more observant<\/strong>. Shift your focus to the whole user and not just the words they are using. In interviews where the user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes. To help capture observations, you\u2019ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ffOa3kj.png\" alt=\"Icon of an ear, and a heading that reads &quot;be an active listener&quot;\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be an active listener<\/strong>. Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you\u2019re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iqpzRQv.png\" alt=\"Icon of a person with arrows pointing towards them, and a heading that reads &quot;request input&quot;\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Request input. <\/strong>It\u2019s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you. So, it\u2019s important to request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users. When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user\u2019s actual thoughts on the experience or product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IvD1AzK.png\" alt=\"Icon of a silhouette of a head, opening up to reveal a brain, heading that reads &quot;Have an open mind&quot;\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have an open mind. <\/strong>We all have biases. Remember, a <strong>bias<\/strong> is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information. As UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fYy6hxK.png\" alt=\"Icon of a magnifying glass, heading that reads &quot;Keep current on UX research&quot;\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep current on UX research<\/strong>. Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you\u2019re designing for. Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Empathy vs. sympathy&nbsp;<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy, but the two terms don\u2019t mean the same thing. <strong>Empathy<\/strong> means understanding someone\u2019s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. <strong>Sympathy<\/strong> is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/B5bEvl2.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By empathizing effectively with your users and doing your best to understand their needs, you build a great foundation for a product experience that will help solve their unique problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">What does empathy mean to you?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing with empathy will enhance the products you create. By building deeper connections with users, you\u2019ll better understand their perspectives and pain points. Finding that connection early can guide you down the right design path and save you from extensive revisions of your product during a later phase of the design process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a focus on empathy, you can design a product that offers users everything they need and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x28nj7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>this video on the power of empathy<\/u><\/a> from Dr. Bren\u00e9 Brown.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The name UX design says it all: the user\u2019s experience is at the center of how we design products.
